# The GEOscraping Pipeline

## Purpose

When a GEOscrape is performed, there are often false positives. This package
contains a pipeline that will help you remove some of these false positives 
(such as scRNA or lncRNA). The pipeline will also aid you in identifying 
needs to be done with each GSEid.

Unfortunatly, the pipeline is not fully automatic, as you will need to manually 
curate GSEs for relevance.

## Contents 

### Main
Contains the main scripts that you will use to run the pipeline.

### Results
Contains the output of the pipeline
