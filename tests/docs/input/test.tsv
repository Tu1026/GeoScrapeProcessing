GSE185749	2021.10.14	Mus musculus,Homo sapiens	GPL20795;GPL21273	TRUE	FALSE	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Transcriptome-wide N6-methyladenine profiling in low input multiplex samples by a kit-free multi-barcode method	N6-methyladnine, which is the most abundant post-transcriptional RNA modification in eukaryotic mRNA, has been proved to be essential in various biological processes and related to numerous diseases. Transcriptome-wide m6A profiling by next generation sequencing is widely used to explore the distributions as well as quantity of m6A modifications. As traditional m6A-seq demands large amount of starting RNA which limited its application to clinical samples, we present a strategy of low input multi-barcode m6A-seq (SLIM-m6A-seq) to realize simplified m6A profiling of mixed clinical samples. This method maintains the advantages of preferable detection limit, low cost and simplified experiment procedures. Sequencing data of clinical blood samples from patients with diabetic myocardial infarction suggest that this method is practical in clinical application and m6A may play a critical role in the progression of diabetic cardiovascular complications.

GSE185727	2021.10.14	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			IL-21-αHSA combined with TIGIT blockade induces an effective anti-tumor immune response	IL-21-αHSA combined with TIGIT blockade induces an effective anti-tumor immune response, indicated by the significant enrichment of pathways associated with anti-tumor immune response, as well as significantly increased expression of key genes associated with CD8+ T and NK cell cytotoxicity To further understand the mechanisms by which IL-21-αHSA enhances the benefit of TIGIT blockade, we analyzed MC38 tumor tissues 20 days after five doses of both single agent and combination treatments by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of 28,758 genes. Compared to isotype control treatment, combination treatment resulted in 764 genes with differential expression (defined as P < 0.05 and fold change > 2.0), while IL-21-αHSA treatment resulted in 402 DEGs and anti-mTIGIT treatment resulted in 528 DEGs (data not shown). These findings suggest that the combination treatment had a more dramatic effect on gene expression than IL-21-αHSA or anti-mTIGIT treatment alone. To evaluate the pathways underlying the synergistic anti-tumor efficacy induced by the combination treatment, we performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway significance enrichment analysis (defined as P adjust < 0.05). In comparison to the isotype control treatment, 41 KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the combination treatment group (Table S1) and 31 pathways were significantly enriched in the IL-21-αHSA treatment group (Table S2), of which 28 KEGG enrichment pathways overlapped. Additionally, only 8 KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the anti-mTIGIT treatment group (Table S3), of which 5 KEGG enrichment pathways overlapped with those of the combination treatment group. These findings suggest that IL-21-αHSA in combination with anti-mTIGIT treatment enriched more KEGG pathways with differential gene expression than for monotherapy, and most of the KEGG pathways significantly enriched by the combination treatment were also differentially enriched by IL-21-αHSA treatment alone. The top 15 pathways, ranked in order of significance, are shown in Fig. 7A. As expected, most are associated with classical anti-tumor immunity signal pathways, including the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, the viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor pathway, the Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathway, the antigen processing and presentation pathway, the T cell receptor signaling pathway, and the PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer (P adjust < 0.0001). The natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway was also significantly enriched (P adjust = 0.0059) in the combination treatment group compared to isotype control treatment group, but was not among the top 15 pathways. Overall, these findings suggest that IL-21-αHSA in combination with TIGIT blockade treatment significantly affects the anti-tumor immunity signal in the tumor micro-environment. For further verification, we analyzed the gene expression levels of key effector molecules, including Interferon-γ (IFNG), Granzyme A (Gzma), Granzyme B (Gzmb), and Perforin 1 (Prf1), each of which are critical mediators of CD8+ T cell and NK cell cytotoxicity and are known to play critical roles in anti-tumor response. As shown in Fig. 7B-E, the combination treatment significantly increased the expression of all four genes (P < 0.05) relative to isotype control treatment, though only IFNG and Gzma were differentially expressed in the combination treatment group relative to the anti-mTIGIT group (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that IL-21-αHSA in combination with TIGIT blockade induces an effective anti-tumor immune response, indicated by the significant enrichment of pathways associated with anti-tumor immune response, as well as significantly increased expression of key genes associated with CD8+ T and NK cell cytotoxicity.		2021-04-06;anti-mTIGIT;Combination;MC38 tumor;about 8 weeks;School of Pharmacy,Fudan University;Isotype Control;IL-21-αHSA
GSE185714	2021.10.14	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			scPower accelerates and optimizes the design of multi-sample single cell transcriptomic studies	Single cell RNA-seq has revolutionized transcriptomics by providing cell type resolution for differential gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses. However, efficient power analysis methods for single cell data and inter-individual comparisons are lacking. Here, we present scPower; a statistical framework for the design and power analysis of multi-sample single cell transcriptomic experiments. We modelled the relationship between sample size, the number of cells per individual, sequencing depth, and the power of detecting differentially expressed genes within cell types. We systematically evaluated these optimal parameter combinations for several single cell profiling platforms, and generated broad recommendations.  In general, shallow sequencing of high numbers of cells leads to higher overall power than deep sequencing of fewer cells. The model, including priors, is implemented as an R package and is accessible as a web tool. scPower is a highly customizable tool that experimentalists can use to quickly compare a multitude of experimental designs and optimize for a limited budget.		peripheral blood mononuclear cells
GSE185702	2021.10.14	Rattus norvegicus	GPL15084	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Enhanced glucose metabolism through activation of HIF-1α covers the energy demand in a rat embryonic heart primordium after heartbeat initiation.	The initiation of heartbeat is an essential step in cardiogenesis in the heart primordium, but it remains unclear how intracellular metabolism responds to increased energy demands after heartbeat initiation. In this study, embryos in Wistar rats at embryonic day 10, at which heartbeat begins in rats, were divided into two groups by the heart primordium before and after heartbeat initiation and their metabolic characteristics were assessed. Metabolome analysis revealed that increased levels of ATP, a main product of glucose catabolism, and reduced glutathione, a by-product of the pentose phosphate pathway, were the major determinants in the heart primordium after heartbeat initiation. Glycolytic capacity and ATP synthesis-linked mitochondrial respiration were significantly increased, but subunits in complexes of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were not upregulated in the heart primordium after heartbeat initiation. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α was activated and a glucose transporter and rate-limiting enzymes of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways, which are HIF-1α-downstream targets, were upregulated in the heart primordium after heartbeat initiation. These results suggest that the HIF-1α-mediated enhancement of glycolysis with activation of the pentose phosphate pathway, potentially leading to antioxidant defense and nucleotide biosynthesis, covers the increased energy demand in the beating and developing heart primordium.		heart primordium, pre-heartbeat;Wister rat;E10;embryo;heart primordium, from rat(E10 pre-heartbeat);heart primordium, from rat(E10 post-heartbeat);heart primordium, post-heartbeat

GSE185627	2021.10.14	Homo sapiens	GPL20795	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			EBV-induced CXCL8 upregulation promotes vasculogenic mimicry in gastric carcinoma via NF-κB signaling	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) is a distinct entity that has conspicuously tumor microenvironment compared with EBV-negative gastric carcinoma. However, the exact role of EBV in gastric carcinogenesis remains elusive. In the present study, we found that EBV upregulated CXCL8 expression, and CXCL8 significantly promoted vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation of gastric carcinoma cells. In accordance with these observations, CXCL8 increased cell proliferation and migration of AGS and BGC823 cells, respectively. In addition, activation of NF-κB signaling was involved in VM formation induced by CXCL8, which was blocked by NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082. Furthermore, EBV encoded lncRNA RPMS1 activated the NF-κB signaling cascade, which is responsible for EBV-induced VM formation. Both xenografts and clinical samples of EBVaGC exhibit VM histologically, which are correlated with CXCL8 over-expression. Finally, CXCL8 is positively correlated with overall survival in gastric carcinoma patients. In conclusion, EBV-upregulated CXCL8 expression promotes VM formation in gastric carcinoma via NF-κB signaling and CXCL8 may serve as a novel anti-tumor target for EBVaGC.

We generated TBX3 knockout pluripotent stem cell lines and found that liver differentiation is also impaired in humans. Interestingly we noted expression of pancreas-specific genes during the liver differentiation in the TBX3 knockout line.

These studies demonstrated that the loss of TBX3 enhances pancreatic-gene signature, implicating TBX3 as a regulator of fate decisions.

We found that the combination of osimertinib and pemetrexed could induce strong apoptotic activity and enhance anti-tumor effects compared to monotherapy in two NSCLC cell lines harboring an EGFR mutation. In addition, we have identified PLK1 as a therapeutic target for combination therapy and as a promising treatment target for overcoming resistance to osimertinib in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients.		negative control;pemetrexed;H1975;Lung adenocarcinoma cell line;PC9;osimertinib;osimertinib and pemetrexed

GSE161061	2021.10.14	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	47	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Phenotypic plasticity and genetic rewiring underlie adaptation in response to hypomorphic alleles of an essential gene	Adaptive evolution in response to cellular stress is a critical process implicated in a wide range of core biological and clinical phenomena. Two major routes of adaptation have been identified: non-genetic cellular plasticity, which allows expression of different phenotypes in novel environments, and genetic variation achieved by selection of fitter phenotypes. While these processes are now broadly accepted, their temporal and epistatic features in the context of cellular evolution and emerging drug resistance are contentious. In this manuscript, we generated hypomorphic alleles of the essential nuclear pore complex (NPC) gene NUP58. By dissecting both early and long-term mechanisms of adaptation in independent clones, we observed that early physiological adaptation correlated with transcriptome rewiring and upregulation of genes known to interact with the NPC. In contrast, long-term adaptation and fitness recovery occurred via focal amplification of NUP58 and restoration of mutant protein expression. These data support the concept that plasticity-mediated and genetic routes can co-exist to enable cellular evolution, with early flexibility of phenotype allowing later acquisition of genetic adaptations to a specific impairment. We propose this approach as a genetic model to mimic targeted drug therapy in human cells and dissection of early and late adaptation. Targeting both mechanisms in parallel may reduce the emergence of drug resistance		HAP1 cell line;HCT116 cell line;NUP58 mutated;wild-type;ctrl_Cas9 transfected without gRNA

During ageing, p16-expressing (P16pos) cells accumulate in tissues and promote multiple age-related pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. We evaluated the accumulation and the phenotype of senescent cells in the aged brain with a transgenic reporter mouse (p16-3MR), which allows for isolation of P16poscells. First, we showed that the number of P16pos cells is significantly increased in old brains. Second, using bulk RNAseq, we demonstrated that P16pos cells express high levels of inflammatory and lysosomal genes. Third, using single-cell RNAseq, we identified P16pos brain cells as being primarily microglia. Interestingly, the transcriptional profile of P16pos microglia cells is distinct from cell type signatures associated with senescence or defined microglia populations. Taken together, our study provides evidence for the accumulation of a novel P16pos microglia population in the aging brain, which could result in loss of tissue homeostasis and contribute to brain dysfunction.

GSE185855	2021.10.13	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	69	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Whole blood transcriptional signatures associated with rapid antidepressant response to ketamine in patients with treatment resistant depression.	Ketamine has rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). However, the underlying mechanisms of action are not well understood. There is increasing evidence that TRD is associated with a pro-inflammatory state and that ketamine may inhibit inflammatory cytokine production. We investigated whole blood transcriptional profiles related to TRD and gene expression changes associated with treatment response to ketamine. Whole blood was collected at baseline (21 healthy controls [HC], 26 patients with TRD) and then again in patients with TRD 24 hours following a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). We performed RNA-sequencing and compared a) baseline transcriptional profiles between patients with TRD and HC, b) responders vs. non-responders before ketamine treatment, and c) gene expression signatures associated with clinical improvement. At baseline, patients with TRD compared to HC were characterized by a gene expression signature indicative of interferon signaling pathway activation. Prior to ketamine administration, the metabotropic glutamate receptor gene GRM2 and the ionotropic glutamate receptor gene GRIN2D were upregulated in responders compared to non-responders. Ketamine response was associated with the downregulation of multiple genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines, the predicted inhibition of several interferon signaling associated upstream regulators and the downregulation of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). The current study indicates that response to ketamine may be associated with up-regulation of glutamate receptors at baseline, and linked to transcriptional changes indicative of an anti-inflammatory response following ketamine. One specific anti-inflammatory mechanism might be the downregulation of IDO1 via inhibition of the interferon pathway.		8.6;8.7;PB207;8.8;8.9;PB205;PB169;Blood;26.1;22.4;22.3;22.2;22.1;PB176;26.9;26.8;PB174;PB172;22.8;PB173;22.6;PB215;PB059;PB179;PB212;responder;-;PB219;PB188;PB100;7.1;PB065;7.2;PB186;PB062;7.3;PB183;7.4;7.5;PB182;7.6;7.7;7.8;7.9;PB106;PB069;PB191;25.1;21.2;PB198;PB075;25.8;PB076;PB197;PB230;25.5;PB195;25.4;21.8;25.3;21.7;PB237;CON;PB234;PB080;32.1;6.1;PB122;17.5;6.2;PB087;PB084;PB085;6.5;PB082;6.9;Pre;MDD;20.7;PB092;20.5;28.5;PB098;28.2;PB093;28.1;24.4;PB134;39.7;PB023;PB144;35.8;9.1;9.2;9.3;5.8;5.9;PB147;23.2;23.1;PB154;27.7;PB153;PB150;23.7;PB158;Post;control;nonresponder;38.4;34.1;30.4;30.2;PB045;8.1;8.2;8.3;8.4;8.5
GSE185819	2021.10.13	Homo sapiens,Mus musculus	GPL18573;GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			A microRNA cluster controls fat cell differentiation and adipose tissue expansion by regulating SNCG	The H19X-encoded miR-424(322)/503 cluster regulates multiple cellular functions. Here we report for the first time that it is also a critical linchpin of fat mass expansion. Deletion of this miRNA cluster in mice results in obesity, while increasing the pool of early adipocyte progenitors and hypertrophied adipocytes. Complementary loss and gain of function experiments and RNA sequencing demonstrate that miR-424(322)/503 regulates a conserved genetic program involved in the differentiation and commitment of white adipocytes. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-424(322)/503 targets γ-Synuclein (SNCG), a factor that mediates this program rearrangement by controlling metabolic functions in fat cells, allowing adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue enlargement. Accordingly, diminished miR-424(322) in mice and obese humans co-segregates with increased SNCG in fat and peripheral blood as mutually exclusive features of obesity, being normalized upon weight loss. Our data unveil a previously unknown regulatory mechanism of fat mass expansion tightly controlled by the miR-424(322)/503 through SNCG.		adipocytes_14d_non-targeting control_humans;adipocytes_48h_miR-424(322)/503-overxpression_humans;miR-424(322)/503-overxpression;PA_Wt;non-targeting control;MA_Wt;MEF-derived preadipocytes from miR-KO embryos;adipocytes_48h_non-targeting control_humans;MEF-derived preadipocytes from Wt embryos;MEF-derived adipocytes from miR-KO embryos;OE_48H;OE_14D;14d;48h;preadipocytes_miR-KO_mice;CNT_48H;adipocytes_miR-KO_mice;CNT_14D;adipocytes_Wt_mice;preadipocytes from subcutaneous adipose tissue and differentiated, modified and treated in vitro;MA_KO;PA_KO;miR-KO;preadipocytes_Wt_mice;adipocytes_14d_miR-424(322)/503-overxpression_humans;Wt;MEF-derived adipocytes from Wt embryos

Methods: mRNA from E15 and E18 isolated endothelial cells of wild-type(WT) and UCP2f/f;Tie2-cre mice was extracted. Specifically, Agilent 2100 Bioanalyze was used to quality controlled and quantified. then, mRNA was converted to cDNA and bound the library. RNA-sequencing analysis was used by the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform in Annoroad Genomics Results: Approximately one thousand transcripts showed differential expression between the wild-type(WT) and UCP2ECKO mice brain cortex, with a fold change ≥2 and p value <0.05.Geneontology analysis of the up-regulated genes showed obvious enrichment of biological processes related to development process and regulation of cell communication.The down-regulated genes exhibited enrichment of biological processes related to cell fate commitment. These results reflected endothelial UCP2 plays roles in cortex development.

However, it remains unanswered how UPF1 expression retarded HCC proliferation. Thus, this study employed UPF1 variants to evaluate the UPF1 function in HCC growth inhibition. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the level of DUSP1, dual specificity phosphatase 1, was upregulated by UPF1 variants by posttranscriptional regulation.

GSE185652	2021.10.13	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	11	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Transcriptomics of human adenocarcinoma cell line HCT-8 infected with Cryptosporidium parvum treated with indole	Purpose: The goal of this study was to identify transcriptional changes in HCT-8 cells treated with indole for 4 or 12 hours. Methods: Confluent HCT-8 monolayers were infected with excysted Cryptosporidium parvum sporozoites for 4 h, after which cells were washed to remove extracellular parasites. Cells were then treated with 1% DMSO in cell culture medium with or without 880 uM indole. RNA was collected in triplicate for each treatment type after 4 h and 12 h of treatment (8 and 16 hours post infection, respectively). Results: When the two time points were combined, indole significantly upregulated 57 genes and downregulated 11 genes. Of the upregulated genes,16 genes were primarily upregulated in cells exposed to indole for 4 h and then went back down by 12 h of exposure. These genes were primarily involved in pathways related to ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Conversely, 41 genes had higher gene expression after 12 h of indole exposure and were predominantly involved in membrane transport of carboxylic acids and amino acids. Conclusions: Indole treatment causes ER stress and upregulation of membrane transporters in a human adenocarcinoma cell line infected with Cryptosporidium parvum.

GSE185646	2021.10.13	Mus musculus	GPL23038	TRUE	TRUE	12	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Effects of murine Oncostatin M on OP9 stromal cells and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts	The IL-6 cytokine Oncostatin M (OSM) is involved in cell development, growth, hematopoiesis, inflammation and cancer. Intriguingly, OSM has proliferative and antiproliferative effects de-pending on the target cell. The molecular mechanisms underlying these opposing effects are not fully understood and its role in tumorigenesis remains controversial. In the present study, we investigated the effect of murine OSM (mOSM) on proliferation in two cell types of distinct origin. We found that mOSM impairs the proliferation of murine bone marrow (BM) stromal cell lines and primary BM stromal cells, whereas murine fibroblasts responded to mOSM with increased proliferation. When we set out to reveal the mechanisms underlying these opposing effects of OSM on proliferation, we detected increased expression of the OSM receptors OSMR and LIFR in stromal cells. Interestingly, Osmr knockdown and Lifr overexpression attenuated the OSM-mediated effect on proliferation in both cell lines indicating that mOSM affected the pro-liferation of both cell lines signaling mainly through the OSMR. Furthermore, mOSM induced activation of the JAK-STAT, PI3K-AKT and MAPK-ERK pathways in OP9 and NIH/3T3 cells with differences in total protein levels between the two cell lines. Our findings offer new insights into the regulation of proliferation by mOSM.		fibroblast;NIH/3T3;connective tissue;stroma;OP9;10 ng/mL of OSM;none;bone marrow

In this prospective study, endometrial tissue samples collected from EC patients (n = 30) and healthy volunteers (n = 10) were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing of the microbiome. The 30 paired tumor and adjacent nontumor endometrial tissues from the EC group were subjected to RNAseq. Result: We found that Pelomonas and Prevotella were enriched in the EC group with a high tumor burden. Further transcriptome analysis identified 8 robust associations between Prevotella and fibrin degradation-related genes expressed within ECs. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the increasing abundance of Prevotella in endometrial tissue combined with high serum DD and FDP contents may be important factors associated with tumor burden.		54 years;49 years;69 years;59 years;famale;57 years;endometrial tissue;52 years;paired adjacent nontumor tissue;67 years;63 years;Cancer tissue;65 years;68 years;40 years;55 years;50 years;60 years;51 years;56 years;66 years;48 years;46 years;43 years;53 years

Methods: hESCs were differentiated into neural cells (mainly cortical interneurons), which were then cultured in media with or without ethanol (50-100 mM) for 7 days (by duplicate experiments). Total RNAs were extracted from hESC-derived neural cells (with or without ethanol exposure) for mRNA sequencing. The sequence reads were processed using the RNA-seq processing pipeline Pipeliner [Front Genet. 2019; 10:614] workflow. Ethanol-induced mRNA transcriptomic changes were analyzed by the Limma-Voom method. Results: When the significance level was set at FC>2.0 & P<0.01, 19 coding genes showed differential expression, and all of them were downregulated after a 7-day ethanol exposure. Conclusions: The hESC-derived neural cell model study can partially validate mRNA transcriptomic changes in postmortem brains of subjects with alcohol use disorder.

Nevertheless, the discovery of selective blockers of lymphovascular niches has been compromised by the paucity of experimental systems for whole-body analyses of tumor progression. Spatio-temporal analyses in autochthonous melanomas and patient-derived xenografts identified double stranded RNA mimics (dsRNA nanoplexes) as potent repressors of lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Mechanistically, dsRNA nanoplexes were found to suppress lymphangiogenic drivers in both tumor cells and their associated lymphatic vasculature (via MIDKINE and Vegfr3, respectively). This dual inhibitory action, driven by type I interferon, was not shared by FDA-approved antimelanoma treatments or by lymphangiogenic blockers in clinical testing.

On the other hand, the cross-talk between macrophages and MSCs confirms that the paracrine molecules derived from macrophages are also carefully regulated by MSCs. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) could reduce secretions of inflammatory factors from macrophages for improving injury healing. hucMSC-derived extracellular matrix (hucMSC-ECM) exhibit nature similar to hucMSCs. It has been demonstrated that hucMSC-ECM possess considerable effects on reducing inflammatory response of macrophages, while the role of hucMSC-ECM on the expression of macrophage-derived paracrine osteogenic molecules is unclear. Here, we presented the decalcified bone scaffolds modified by hucMSC-derived extracellular matrix (DBM-ECM) maintaining multiple soluble cytokines including macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Compared with DBM, the DBM-ECM scaffolds induced bone formation in a macrophage-depending manner by an improved heterotopic ossification in SCID mice with or without macrophage depletion. Macrophage cocultured with the DBM-ECM expressed four osteoinductive cytokines (BMP2, FGF2, TGFβ3 and OSM), which were screen out by RNA sequencing, qPCR and western blot. The conditioned medium from macrophages cocultured with the DBM-ECM improved osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs and activated CD74/CD44 signal transduction including phosphorylation of P38 and dephosphorylation of c-jun. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the DBM-ECM scaffolds with knockdown of MIF on osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo revealed that macrophage-mediated osteogenesis depends on MIF/CD74/ P38 signal transduction. This study indicates the coordinated crosstalk of macrophages and MSCs play a key role on bone regeneration induced by the DBM-ECM, with the emphasis on the constructing macrophage-derived osteoimmunological microenvironment.		macrophages;THP-1 cells were differentiated to macrophages with 50 ng/mL of PMA for 48-h and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS with DBM scaffolds for 7 days.;THP-1 cells were differentiated to macrophages with 50 ng/mL of PMA for 48-h and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS with DBM scaffolds for 3 days.;THP-1 cells were differentiated to macrophages with 50 ng/mL of PMA for 48-h and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS with DBM-ECM scaffolds for 7 days.;Human monocytic cell line THP-1;THP-1 cells were differentiated to macrophages with 50 ng/mL of PMA for 48-h and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS with DBM-ECM scaffolds for 3 days.

Accumulating evidence suggests a pathological role for PARP-1 in breast cancer through its effects on the transcription of tumor-related genes. Here we report the role of PARP-1 in estrogen-dependent transcription in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancers. Global nuclear run-on and sequencing (GRO-seq) and RNA-seq analyses suggest that PARP-1 controls the expression of estrogen-regulated genes in ER-positive (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Further, ChIP-seq analyses revealed that PARP-1 directly regulates the ligand-dependent binding of ERa and FoxA1 to a subset of its genomic binding sites. Finally, we uncovered that the expression levels of the PARP-1 and estrogen coregulated gene set are enriched in luminal molecular-subtype of breast tumors and high PARP-1 expression in ER+ cases correlates with poor survival. Additionally, treatment with PARP-1 selective inhibitors showed attenuated estrogen-dependent growth of ER+ breast cancer cells. Taken together, the current study suggests that PARP-1 regulates critical molecular pathways that underlie proliferation of ER+ breast cancer cells.

Recently we identified cytotoxic ILC3s characterized by expression of CD94. Here we analyzed the full spectrum of CD127+ ILCs and NK cells in intestinal lamina propria from healthy donors and Crohn’s disease patients and identified two populations of CD127+CD94+ ILCs, designated A and B that could be distinguished on expression of CD117, CD18 and cytotoxic molecules. Population B highly expressed granulysin, a cytotoxic molecule linked to bacterial lysis and/or chemotaxis of monocytes. Granulysin protein was amply secreted by population B cells upon stimulation with IL-15. Activation of population B in the presence of TGF-β strongly reduced the expression of cytotoxic effector molecules of population B. Strikingly, samples from individuals that suffer from active Crohn disease displayed dramatically enhanced frequencies of granulysin expressing effector CD127+CD94+ ILCs compared to non-inflamed controls.

However, how TET enzymes are recruited and regulated at these genomic loci is not fully understood. Here, we identify TET2 and a previously undescribed proline and serine rich protein, PROSER1 as interactors of UTX, a component of the enhancer-associated MLL3/4 complexes. Affinity purification of PROSER1 resulted in the identification of OGT and TET1-3. We find that PROSER1 mediates the interaction between OGT and TET2, thus promoting TET2 O-GlcNAcylation and protein stability. Additionally, PROSER1, UTX, OGT, and TET1/2 colocalize on many genomic elements genome-wide. Loss of PROSER1 results in lower enrichment of UTX, and TET1/2 at enhancers and CpG islands, with a concomitant increase in DNA methylation and transcriptional downregulation of associated target genes and increased DNA hypermethylation encroachment at H3K4me1-predisposed CpG islands. Taken together, this study describes for the first time a regulator of TET2 O-GlcNAcylation and its implications in mediating DNA demethylation at UTX-dependent enhancers and CpG islands.

But how tumor cell-intrinsic cytosolic DNA sensing is initiated by radiation remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrated that STING-mediated type I interferon production in tumor cells after radiation relied on the engagement of MLKL-mediated necroptosis, which was elicited by the ZBP1-RIPK3 signaling axis. Physiologically, tumor cell-intrinsic ZBP1-MLKL cascade augmented antitumor immune responses after radiation largely by regulating STING signaling. Mechanistically, ZBP1-MLKL-dependent necroptosis maintained the enrichment of mitochondria DNA inside the cytosol of tumor cells after radiation in a cell-density dependent fashion, contributing to type I interferon responses. In contrast, ablation of caspase-8 unleashed ZBP1-MLKL cascade to gain enhanced cytosolic DNA sensing, and in turn potentiated therapeutic effects of radiation. Thus, our findings uncover an unanticipated mechanism that ZBP1-MLKL-dependent necroptosis drives cytosolic DNA sensing-mediated antitumor immunity after radiation, and provide new strategy to improve radiotherapy by inhibiting caspase-8 cascade.

Previous studies have identified dynamic changes in the tRNA supply and mRNA demand during cancerous proliferation. Yet, dynamic changes may occur also during physiologically normal proliferation, and these are less characterized. We examined the tRNA and mRNA pools of T-cells during their vigorous proliferation and differentiation upon triggering of the T cell antigen receptor. We observe a global signature of switch in demand for codon at the early proliferation phase of the response, accompanied by corresponding changes in tRNA expression levels. In the later phase, upon differentiation of the T cells, the response of the tRNA pool is relaxed back to basal level, potentially restraining excessive proliferation. Sequencing of tRNAs allowed us to also evaluate their diverse base-modifications. We found that two types of tRNA modifications, Wybutosine and ms2t6A, are reduced dramatically during T-cell activation. These modifications occur in the anti-codon loops of two tRNAs that decode “slippery codons”, that are prone to ribosomal frameshifting. Attenuation of these frameshift-protective modifications is expected to increase proteome-wide frameshifting during T-cell proliferation. Indeed, human cell lines deleted of a Wybutosine writer showed increased ribosomal frameshifting, as detected with a reporter that consists of a critical frameshifting site taken from the HIV gag-pol slippery codon motif. These results may explain HIV’s specificity to proliferating T-Cells since it requires ribosomal frameshift exactly on this codon for infection. The changes in tRNA expression and modifications uncover a new layer of translation regulation during T-cell proliferation and exposes a potential trade-off between cellular growth and translation fidelity.		ribo-seq activated CD4 T-cells, 48 hours after activation;ribo-seq activated CD4 T-cells, 72 hours after activation;20 hours;CD4 T-cells;mRNA;72 hours;mRNA-sequencing activated CD4 T-cells, 20 hours after activation;mRNA-sequencing activated CD4 T-cells, 48 hours after activation;mRNA-sequencing activated CD4 T-cells, 72 hours after activation;mRNA-sequencing Naïve CD4 T-cells;48 hours;ribo-seq activated CD4 T-cells, 20 hours after activation;Ribosome protected mRNA;B6;naïve;ribo-seq Naïve CD4 T-cells

These modifications occur in the anti-codon loops of two tRNAs that decode “slippery codons”, that are prone to ribosomal frameshifting. Attenuation of these frameshift-protective modifications is expected to increase proteome-wide frameshifting during T-cell proliferation. Indeed, human cell lines deleted of a Wybutosine writer showed increased ribosomal frameshifting, as detected with a reporter that consists of a critical frameshifting site taken from the HIV gag-pol slippery codon motif. These results may explain HIV’s specificity to proliferating T-Cells since it requires ribosomal frameshift exactly on this codon for infection. The changes in tRNA expression and modifications uncover a new layer of translation regulation during T-cell proliferation and exposes a potential trade-off between cellular growth and translation fidelity.		activated CD4 T-cells, 48 hours after activation, high CD62L;activated CD4 T-cells, 72 hours after activation, low CD62L;48 hours;20 hours;activated CD4 T-cells, 20 hours after activation (sorted for live cells);B6;naïve;CD4 T-cells;Naïve CD4 T-cells (sorted for live cells);72 hours;activated CD4 T-cells, 48 hours after activation, low CD62L;activated CD4 T-cells, 72 hours after activation, high CD62L

Here we address the role of FGF21 in the hepatic metabolic regulation in a mouse model for chronic variable stress (Cvs). Global FGF21KO and WT mice show an intact stress response with short-term Cvs induced alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and gene expression. Hepatic steatosis is found with the highest significance in enrichment analyses of hepatic transcriptome data, with PPARa and SREBP-1 as main upstream regulatory molecules, which are directly associated to FGF21. After 3 months recovery, stress-related metabolic improvements are not visible in FGF21KO mice in contrast to WT mice, indicating the crucial role of FGF21 in the post-stress metabolic adaptations. Overall, we suggest that Cvs-induced gene regulation determines the metabolic late effects after stress. Furthermore, FGF21 is a key player in the protection from stress-induced hepatic lipid accumulation.		Cvs;liver;FGF21KO (Fgf21-/-);FGF21WT (Fgf21+/+);Ctrl

As such, FOXR2 expression identifies another subset of neuroblastoma patients with unfavorable clinical outcome. Background: Clinical outcomes of neuroblastoma patients range from spontaneous tumor regression to fatality. Hence, understanding the mechanisms that cause tumor progression are crucial for the treatment of patients.

However, physical identification of the Aire’s targets has been hampered by the low and promiscuous nature of TRA expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). We have tackled this issue by engineering mice with augmented Aire expression. By combining the transcriptomic data from Aire-augmented and Aire-deficient mTECs, we searched for Aire’s targets with the aid of bioinformatics.		8 weeks old;thymus;Aire-3xAire/3xAire;thymic epithelial cells;Aire-/-;Aire+/+;C57BL/6

The quality of the immune infiltrate in luminal-like BCs has been poorly studied, thus a biological basis for the further investigation of immunotherapeutic strategies is missing. By using high-dimensional single-cell technologies, we identified heterogeneous behavior within the tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (Trm) cells infiltrating luminal-like tumors. We defined that a subset of CD127- CD39hi Trm cells is preferentially present in the tumor compared to the adjacent normal breast tissue or peripheral blood, displayed enhanced effector functions compared to the CD127+ CD39lo Trm counterpart, and was specifically associated with positive prognosis. Nevertheless, the prognostic benefit was lost in the presence of highly-suppressive CCR8hi ICOShi IRF4+ effector Tregs. Our results suggest that combinatorial strategies aiming at boosting Trm function while relieving from Treg-mediated immunosuppression are needed to achieve proper tumor control in luminal-like BCs.

Nevertheless, RNA splicing, a striking feature in shaping transcriptome and enabling the generation of vast transcripts and diverse proteins, has never been illustrated in this transient endothelial to HSC conversion. Here, we constructed an isoform-based transcriptome landscape during HSC development at single-cell resolution, which enables the identification of hemogenic signature isoforms, as well as stage-specific splicing events. Combining with functional screening, we showed that the inclusion of such hemogenic-specific exons was essential for hemogenic function in vitro. Moreover, their gradual appearance along with HSC specification from endothelia cells was orchestrated by the splicing regulator Srsf2. Therefore, early Srsf2 deficiency from endothelia cells dramatically impaired the HSC generation, which was accompanied by changes in splicing pattern of several master hematopoietic regulators. These results redefine our understanding of the dynamic transcriptome diversity and demonstrate that the elaborate control of splicing governs cell fate in HSC formation.

We employ a multidisciplinary approach to convincingly demonstrate that neurotoxicant exposure- and genetic mutation-driven mitochondrial dysfunction share a common mechanism of epigenetic dysregulation. Under both scenarios, lysine 27 acetylation of likely variant H3.2 (H3.2K27ac) increased in dopaminergic neuronal models of PD, thereby opening that region to active enhancer activity via H3K27 hyperacetylation. These vulnerable epigenomic loci represent potential transcription factor motifs for PD pathogenesis. Our results reveal an exciting axis of ‘exposure/mutation-mitochondrial dysfunction-metabolism-H3K27ac-transcriptome’ for PD pathogenesis.

Among these pathways, enzymes that degrade tryptophan and arginine are thought to suppress activated T cells in the tumor microenvironment and are therefore attractive drug targets. However, how amino acid metabolism controls the development and progression of cancer has remained elusive, since commonly used implantable tumor models may not faithfully recapitulate the complex cellular and biochemical interactions within tumor microenvironments. To address this, we generated a novel, penetrant autochthonous model of neuroblastoma to accurately quantify tumor growth non-invasively and simultaneously genetically manipulate the enzymes that mediate tryptophan and arginine metabolism, and the cells that express them. We established that tumor development and growth were dependent on infiltrating CCR2+ bone marrow-derived myeloid cells but independent of Stat6-dependent ‘M2’ macrophages. Macrophages can modulate CD4+ T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation by consuming amino acids and forcing the T cells to remain in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Indeed, we found that CD4+ T cells deprived of arginine increased Foxp3 expression and adopted a unique regulatory-like phenotype. Notably, depletion of CD4+ T cells like CCR2+ macrophages, virtually eliminated tumor formation. When rare tumors did form in CD4-depleted mice, they contained Foxp3+ CD8 T cells, suggesting regulatory T cell activity is a fundamental requirement for tumor development. When we ablated macrophage arginase 1 (Arg1), an enzyme that locally consumes arginine, in the tumor-prone background, almost no tumors were observed. Therefore, Arg1 and arginine metabolism form a pro-tumor pathway. We extended these findings to two pathways of programmed myeloid tryptophan metabolism (IDO1, IDO2, IL4i1). Like Arg1, expression of these enzymes was confined to myeloid cells in humans and mice, and each enzyme was independently essential for tumor formation and growth. The protective effects of genetic ablation of each myeloid amino acid pathways uniformly occurred early in tumor formation, arguing that a network of immune cells controlled by myeloid amino acid metabolism and CD4+ T cells is important for the origins of a pro-tumor environment. Our results establish an unappreciated potency of macrophage amino acid metabolism in promoting malignancy, and suggest that these pathways can be disabled by targeting of myeloid amino acid metabolism. OVA-specific CD4+ T cells were stimulated with peptide in the presence of APCs (CD3-depleted splenocytes) either in control complete RPMI-1640 (containing 10% dialyzed FBS) or in RPMI-1640 (containing 10% dialyzed FBS) containing 1% of the normal arginine levels (12uM) to characterize the effects of limited arginine availability on gene expression.

We have previously identified IL-5-producing Th2 cells as the pathogenic population predominantly involved in the pathology of allergic inflammation. However, the cell-intrinsic signaling pathways that control the pathogenic Th2 cell function are still unclear. We herein report the high expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) in pathogenic CD4+ T cell population in the lung and skin. The genetic deletion of CD4+ T cell-intrinsic ACC1 dampened eosinophilic and basophilic inflammation in the lung and skin by constraining IL-5 or IL-3 production. Mechanistically, ACC1-dependent fatty acid biosynthesis induces the pathogenic cytokine production of CD4+ T cells via metabolic reprogramming and the availability of acetyl-CoA for epigenetic regulation. We thus identified a distinct phenotype of the pathogenic T cell population in the lung and skin, and ACC1 was shown to be an essential regulator controlling the pathogenic function of these populations to promote type 2 inflammation.

It is now established that stratum corneum is thinner and dryer, and that skin contains less natural moisturizing factors and lipids in newborns compared to children and adults. Moreover, it has been shown that skin surface area expansion is not linear throughout life and is peaking perinatally, suggesting that baby skin has a higher epidermal cellular turnover. Despite growing resources showing differences between adult and infant skin physiology, molecular and metabolic specificities of baby skin are still poorly understood. To address this critical knowledge gap, we performed an integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic study comparing human primary keratinocytes from babies and adults. Based on state-of-the-art integrative frameworks, our analyses revealed a major shift in the global energetic metabolism in baby keratinocytes compared to adults, highlighting increased amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in baby cells to fuel TCA cycle, while showing glycolysis as the major cell energy source in adult cells.

The Stat3 deficiency determined the barrier integrity that lowered threshold of inflammation, but this step was not sufficient to form pathogenicity.

Currently, there are no drugs to stop drusen formation or RPE atrophy in AMD. We developed an iPSC-RPE AMD model that recapitulates drusen and RPE atrophy. Drusen deposition is dependent on AMD-risk-allele CFH(H/H) and anaphylatoxin triggered alternate complement signaling via the activation of NF-B and downregulation of autophagy pathways.

Vitamin D supplementation has shown anti-inflammatory effects in many diseases; gut microbiota is also associated with a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases, but potential role of vitamin D and gut microbiota in high-salt diet-induced hypertension remains unclear. Therefore, we used rats with hypertension induced by a high-salt diet as the research object and analyzed the transcriptome of their tissues (kidney and colon) and gut microbiome to conduct an overall analysis of the gut–kidney axis. We aimed to confirm the effects of high salt and calcitriol on the gut–kidney immune system and the composition of the intestinal flora. We demonstrate that consumption of a high-salt diet results in hypertension and inflammation in the colon and kidney and alteration of gut microbiota composition and function. High-salt diet-induced hypertension was found to be associated with seven microbial taxa and mainly associated with reduced production of the protective short-chain fatty acid butyrate. Calcitriol reduced colon and kidney inflammation and restored the intestinal barrier function, and the protective effect may be mediated indirectly by immunological properties. Additionally, the molecular pathways of the gut microbiota-mediated BP regulation may be related to circadian rhythm signals, which needs to be further investigated. An innovative association analysis of the microbiota may be a key strategy to understanding the association between gene patterns and host.		NC;Cortex;HS;Colon;CAL

However, it is unclear how Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay is controlled in interleukin (IL)-1β or Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-stimulated cells. Here, by analyzing the Regnase-1 interactome, we found that IL-1β or TLR stimulus dynamically induced the formation of Regnase-1-β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTRCP) complex. Importantly, we also uncovered a novel interaction between Regnase-1 and 14-3-3 in both mouse and human cells. Strikingly, both interactions occur in a mutually exclusive manner, underscoring the importance of modulating Regnase-1’s activity. Additionally, we show that in IL-1R/TLR-stimulated cells, the Regnase-1-14-3-3 interaction is mediated by IRAK1 through a previously uncharacterized C-terminal structural domain. Phosphorylation of Regnase-1 at S494 and S513 is critical for Regnase-1-14-3-3 interaction, while a different set of phosphorylation sites of Regnase-1 are known to be required for the recognition by βTRCP and proteasome-mediated degradation. 14-3-3 stabilizes Regnase-1 but abolishes its activity by inhibiting Regnase-1-mRNA association. Furthermore, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Regnase-1 is abrogated by 14-3-3 interaction. Taken together, the results suggest that a novel inflammation-induced interaction of 14-3-3 with Regnase-1 stabilizes inflammatory mRNAs by sequestering Regnase-1 in the cytoplasm to prevent mRNA recognition.

In human ovarian cancer we show that tumor-reactive intraepithelial (ie)CD8+ TILs engaged by antigen are polyfunctional and upregulate PD-1, which restrains their effectiveness. PD-1+ TILs exhibit a continuum of TCR-engaged/exhausted states with variable effector fitness related to CD28 costimulation, which they receive in intraepithelial niches involving myeloid antigen-presenting cells (mAPC). Following PD-1 blockade, activation of TILs requires CD28 costimulation mediated in situ by tumor mAPCs, which is locally enhanced by CTLA-4 blockade. CD40 ligand also amplifies TIL responses in situ, especially in tumors in which mAPCs are not activated. Thus, dysfunctional and exhausted TILs, in a state of TCR engagement but without proper CD28 costimulation by mAPCs in situ, are unlikely to fully benefit from PD-1 blockade.		1, 13;r7s4vVDJ;CD8+ T cells;r9s1GEX;r8s1vVDJ;r4s1vVDJ, r9s3vVDJ;r9s5GEX;r5Vs4;r8s5vVDJ;r5Vs1;r6s3;r7s3;r8s5GEX;r9s5vVSDJ;ovarian tumor-digest;5s1;r9s4vVDJ;5s4;r8s3GEX;r8s1GEX;r7s6;r8s2vVDJ;ovarian tumor;r8s6vVDJ;r9s2GEX;r9s1vVDJ;r9s4GEX;r9s6vVDJ;r9s6GEX;r8s3vVDJ;r7s1vVDJ;4s1, r9s3GEX;r8s4GEX;r8s6GEX;r9s2vVDJ;r6s1vVDJ;r8s2GEX;r8s4vVDJ

SNU-seq identifies the last transcribed nucleotide at near single-nucleotide resolution. 3'-end RNA-seq is used to examine RNA levels. ChIPmentation and ATAC-seq are used to assess the differential chromatin landscape upon IFNγ treatments, measuring H3K27ac, H3K4me3 and CTCF genome-wide changes as well as DNA accessibility in untreated, 0.5hr, 2hr and 24hr IFNγ treated Hep3B cells. Higher-order chromatin structure is investigated upon IFNγ treatments using Capture-C to measure promoter interactions of three gene promoters; IRF1, STAT1, and CD274. Results: 3'-end RNA-seq reveals IFNγ stimulated genes. SNU-seq identifies dynamic transcription at genes and non-coding intergenic regions and is used to demonstrate differential APA upon IFNγ treatments. By measuring transcription at nucleosome depleted regions, differential enhancer activity was demonstrated. IFNγ induces hundreds of methylation changes and thousands of acetylation changes over 24hrs. Unlike H3K4me3 which is deposited at late timepoints, H3K27ac is dynamically deposited. This acetylation is sometimes sustained throughout 24hrs but is often transiently deposited. CTCF shows very few binding changes throughout the timecourse.

Its autosomal recessive loss of function is the molecular cause of the “nude” phenotype, a severe combined immunodeficiency caused by athymia. Here we report on a spontaneously occurring, novel heterozygous FOXN1 mutation that initially permits regular thymus organogenesis but results in a failure of thymic maintenance beyond late stages of human gestation. Modeling the mutation in mice results in divergent disruptions of normal TEC subtype differentiation and function. Transcriptionally inactive, the mutant disrupts the formation of wild type FOXN1 homo-multimers and occupies canonical DNA binding sites, at which it operates in a dominant negative fashion to displace wild type FOXN1 from nuclear condensates. Comparing the interactome of the mutant and wild type FOXN1 identified binding partners that uniquely interact with wild type FOXN1 and are characteristic constituents of nuclear organelles required for transcription. Mutant FOXN1 moves in and out of condensates over a time-course indistinguishable from that of wild type FOXN1, suggesting that the mutation did not affect the molecular movement of FOXN1. Thus, we have identified a clinically relevant gain of function mutation of FOXN1 that actively prevents the transcriptional activity of wild type FOXN1 and provides critical insight into the mechanism by which FOXN1 operates in controlling sustained gene expression necessary for normal thymic epithelial cell differentiation, maintenance and function.		10X 3' gene expression;d550 FOXN1;WT FOXN1/d550 FOXN1;WT FOXN1;none (input);16 weeks;mTEC4D6;wt Foxn1/wt Foxn1;Empty;ChIP-seq input;NA;RNA-seq;d550 FOXN1-flag;5 weeks;ChIP-seq anti-flag;EpCAM+ CD45- TEC;M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma);WT FOXN1-flag;EpCAM+ CD45- live TEC;mTEC4D6 cell line;wt Foxn1/d505 Foxn1

Prior exposure to RSV affords little protection and many are susceptible to reinfection throughout life. Virally encoded non-structural (NS) protein 1 (NS1) is thought to modulate host responses in the cytosol. Here, we describe the nuclear localization of NS1 during RSV infection and a corresponding nuclear role in modulating host transcription. In support, we show that a significant proportion of NS1 is partitions to the nucleus and that NS1 alone is necessary and sufficient to translocate into the nucleus. NS1 co-localizes with exportin XPO1 and inhibition of XPO1 results in NS1 accumulation in the nucleus. Furthermore, nuclear NS1 is chromatin-associated and co-immunoprecipitates with Mediator complex proteins. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation demonstrates enrichment of NS1 binding overlapping Mediator and interferon-stimulated transcription factor binding sites that lie within regulatory elements of genes differentially expressed during RSV infection. Mutation of the unique alpha helix in NS1 enhances its repressive effect on host gene expression. Together, these data suggest that nuclear NS1 may alter host responses to RSV infection by binding at the promoters and enhancers of host immune response genes and disrupting host transcriptional regulators. Our study identifies yet another regulatory layer of interactions with RSV proteins that shapes host response to RSV and potentially impacts long-term immunity to RSV.

To achieve their clinical promise, sBC need to function comparably to mature adult beta cells, but as yet they display varying degrees of maturity. Indeed, detailed knowledge of the events resulting in human beta cell maturation remains obscure. Here we show that sBC spontaneously self-enrich into discreet islet-like cap structures within in vitro cultures, independent of exogenous maturation conditions. Multiple complementary assays demonstrate that this process is accompanied by functional maturation of the selfenriched sBC (seBC); however, the seBC still contain distinct subpopulations displaying different maturation levels. Interestingly, the surface protein ENTPD3 (also known as nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-3 (NDPTase3)) is a specific marker of the most mature seBC population and can be used for mature seBC identification and sorting. Our results illuminate critical aspects of in vitro sBC maturation and provide important insights towards developing functionally mature sBC for diabetes cell replacement therapy.		hPSC-seBCs;hPSC-eBCs;human iPSCs;ENTPD3- hPSC-seBCs;ENTPD3+ hPSC-seBCs

Nevertheless, they all share the defining features of deregulated growth and a blockade of normal terminal differentiation events. Hematopoietic stem cells appear to be the origin of clones from which human AML may often arise, but the intrinsic and extrinsic processes that establish self-sustaining, overtly leukemic human cell populations remain poorly understood, exacerbated by historical difficulties in developing de novo models of AML in human cells and drawbacks inherent in analyzing leukemic cells obtained from patients or model organisms. The finding that MYC expression is commonly increased in AML cells carrying different upstream driver mutations led us to examine the effects of forcing a modestly enhanced level of expression of this gene in freshly isolated human CD34+ hematopoietic cells. We now show that both early and late types of cells with granulopoietic potential when transduced with a MYC-encoding lentiviral vector produce a rapidly fatal, phenotypically and transcriptionally indistinguishable, serially transplantable AML at high efficiency in immunodeficient mice, but only in recipients that are producing human interleukin-3 (IL3) and/or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In the absence of these human growth factors (GFs), transplants of MYC-transduced CD34+ cells regenerate a normal spectrum of human lymphoid and myeloid progeny. However, upon secondary transfer to human GF-producing mice, they produce a phenotypically similar, rapidly fatal AML. The unique features of this model that include the reproducible creation of a latent AML program in primary human cells that is rapidly activated by inflammatory growth factors portend its utility as a powerful new platform for elucidating critical shared molecular mechanisms responsible for creating aggressive human myeloid leukemias.

A strategy efficiently applied to several tissues is to recapitulate step by step the development of the tissue of interest by exposing hPSCs to the signaling cues used during normal embryonic development. However, this strategy has proven difficult to implement for brown fat as the development of this tissue is poorly characterized. Here, we first used single cell RNA sequencing to characterize the development of interscapular brown fat in mouse. Our analysis identified a previously unrecognized population of brown adipocytes precursors characterized by expression of the transcription factor GATA6. We showed that this precursor population can be efficiently generated from hPSCs by modulating the signaling pathways identified our transcriptomic analysis in paraxial mesoderm precursors differentiated in vitro. These precursors can in turn be efficiently converted into functional brown adipocytes which can respond to adrenergic stimuli by increasing their metabolism resulting in heat production.		day 122;primary tissue;day 0;iPSC;day  115;day 15;day 125;iPSC cell culture;day +40
GSE185512	2021.10.11	Homo sapiens	GPL18573	TRUE	FALSE	180	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Next generation sequencing facilitates quantitative analysis of oncogene induced transcriptomes	Expression of CDC25A, CCNE1, or MYC in MDA-MB-231, BT549, HCC1806, RPE1-TP53wt, and RPE1-TP53mut cells was induced using 1 µg/mL of doxycycline. Cells were harvested and frozen at -80°C at 48 hours and 120 hours after doxycycline induction. Next, RNA was isolated using the mirVANA kit (Ambion, AM1561). To determine RNA quality, RNA was separated by electrophoresis on microfluidic sipper chips and detected by fluorescence (LabChip GX, Caliper LifeSciences). RNA Quality Scores (RQS) were based on electropherogram features (total and fast region areas, 28S, and 18S height), and ranged from 0-10. Only samples with RQS scores above 5 were included for analysis. To generate cDNA libraries suitable for next-generation sequencing (NGS), the QuantSeq RNAseq 3' mRNA kit (Lexogen) was employed. Briefly, the poly-A tail from total RNA was bound to oligo-dT primers to synthesize the first cDNA strand. After RNA removal, a second cDNA strand was synthesized by random priming. The double-stranded cDNA library was purified, and PCR amplified with Illumina sequencing adapters. The libraries were sequenced with 65 base-pair reads on a NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina) and generated 7.2 to 19.8 million of reads per sample.

GSE185192	2021.10.11	Homo sapiens	GPL18573	TRUE	FALSE	64	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Down Syndrome Induced Senescence Disrupts the Nuclear Architecture of Neural Progenitors	We utilized human derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from individuals with Down syndrome and sex matched controls to interrogate the cell type consequences of trisomy 21 (T21). We report the consequences of T21 on the spatial chromatin organization (Hi-C), lamina-associated domains (ChIP-seq), chromatin state (ATAC-seq), and transcriptome (RNA-seq) in an isogenic pair (euploid: Iso-E and trisomic: Iso-T cells derived from the same individual), pair of male individuals with euploid (Ma-E) and trisomic (Ma-T), pair of female individuals with euploid (Fe-E) and trisomic (Fe-T). Our findings show that T21 induces chromosomal introversion, disrupts lamina-associated domains (LADs) and alters the genome-wide chromatin-accessibility of NPCs but not iPSCs. While the overall organization of A/B compartments and location of TAD-boundaries are conserved in NPCs harboring T21, we observe loss of chromatin-accessibility within the A-compartment that is associated with transcriptional downregulation, and increased long-range chromatin interactions in the B-compartment that is associated with transcriptional upregulation. We find that these architectural changes are similar to those observed in senescent cells, and our transcriptional analysis confirms that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in NPCs harboring T21 are highly correlated with DEGs identified in oxidative stress induced senescent cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the senolytic drug combination of dasatinib and quercetin alleviates the genome-wide transcriptional disruption, as well as deficits in cellular migration and proliferation observed in NPCs harboring T21.		untreated;DMSO;none;Down syndrome;GM04616;Control;H9 WA09;AG06922;CS-0020-01;AG05397;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;Neural Progenitor Cells;Dasatinib+Quercetin
GSE183995	2021.10.11	Homo sapiens	GPL16686	TRUE	TRUE	4	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Changes of gene expression related to cellular senescence in human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recognized as potential treatments for multiple degenerative and inflammatory disorders as a number of animal and human studies have indicated their therapeutic effects. There are also several approved medicinal products manufactured using these cells. For large-scale manufacturing requirements, the in vitro expansion of harvested MSCs is essential. Multiple subculturing of MSCs, however, provokes cellular senescence process which is known to deteriorate the therapeutic efficacy of the cells. Strategies to rejuvenate or selectively remove senescent MSCs are therefore highly desirable for fostering future clinical applications of these cells. In this present study, we investigated gene expression changes related to cellular senescence of MSCs derived from umbilical cord blood (hUCB-MSCs) and found that CD26, also known as DPP4, is significantly upregulated upon cellular aging.		mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical cord blood, passage 4;mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical cord blood, passage 9

Comparative chromosomal conformation mapping in Mus spretus and Mus musculus revealed neuron-specific reconfigurations tracking recent ERV2 retrotransposon expansions in the murine germline, with significantly higher B2 megadomain contact frequencies at sites with ongoing ERV2 insertions in Mus musculus. Ablation of the retrotransposon silencer Kmt1e/Setdb1 (KO) triggered B2 megadomain disintegration and rewiring with open chromatin domains enriched for cellular stress response genes, along with severe neuroinflammation and proviral assembly of ERV2/Intracisternal-A-Particles (IAPs) infiltrating dendrites and spines. We conclude that neuronal megadomain architectures include evolutionarily adaptive heterochromatic organization which, upon perturbation, unleashes ERV proviruses with strong tropism within mature neurons.

We previously discovered an AUTS2?Polycomb complex activates gene expression by recruiting Casein kinase 2 (CK2) and P300. But the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of AUTS2-PRC1 to chromatin and the physiological relevance of AUTS2-P300 interaction during neurodevelopment remain unknown. Here, we report that the transcription factor Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF1) physically interacts with AUTS2 and overlaps with AUTS2 on chromatin binding. In a functional study combined with the single cell RNA-seq approach, we demonstrate that NRF1 is required for AUTS2 recruitment to chromatin, ncPRC1 associated active transcription in motor neuron and thereby modulates multipotent progenitors to motor neuron differentiation. Moreover, we discover that mutations within AUTS2 HX repeat region, which associate with RSTS phenotype disrupt AUTS2-P300 interaction and AUTS2 mediated transcriptional activation. Together, these findings reveal the underlying mechanism by which the AUTS2-containing ncPRC1 complex is recruited and activates transcription and mutations in the AUTS2 HX repeat region exert a dominant negative effect on AUTS2-P300 mediated transcriptional activation in RSTS.

Here we introduce Ladder-seq, an approach that separates transcripts according to their lengths prior to sequencing and uses the additional information to improve the quantification and assembly of transcripts. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that a kallisto algorithm extended to process Ladder-seq data quantifies transcripts of complex genes with substantially higher accuracy than conventional kallisto. For reference-based assembly, a modified StringTie2 algorithm reconstructs a single transcript with 30.8% higher precision than its conventional counterpart and is >30% more sensitive for complex genes. For de novo assembly, a modified Trinity algorithm correctly assembles 78% more transcripts than conventional Trinity, while improving precision by 78%.

CBX proteins in differentiated lineages have chromatin compaction and phase separation activities that might contribute to maintaining repressed chromatin. The predominant CBX protein in pluripotent cells, CBX7, lacks the domain required for these activities. We inserted this functional domain into CBX7 in embryonic stem cells to test the hypothesis that it contributes a key epigenetic function. ESCs expressing this chimeric CBX7 were impaired in their ability to properly form embryoid bodies and neural progenitor cells and showed reduced activation of lineage-specific genes across differentiation. Neural progenitors exhibited a corresponding inappropriate maintenance of Polycomb binding at neural-specific loci over the course of differentiation. We propose that a switch in the ability to compact and phase separate is a central aspect of Polycomb group function during the transition from pluripotency to differentiated lineages.		10 days;CBX7 KO;6 days;Neural progenitor cells;CBX7-mCaPS;Embryonic stem cells;Embryoid bodies;WT;0 days;J1 cells;8 days;CBX7-CaPS

Using laser-assisted microdissection, we isolated the mural trophectoderm of E4.5 (non-implanted embryo) and E4.75 blastocysts (attached to the uterine wall). As the invasive trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) at early egg cylinder stage (implanted embryo) are not accessible, we allowed the E4.5 mural TE to differentiate into TGCs in vitro for 3 days and then we proceeded with the transcriptional analysis. In addition, we analysed the transcriptome of the endothelial cells of the E5.5 decidua and the bEnd5 endothelial cell line. We found that the trophoblast activates the expression of a large repertoire of vascular receptors, ligands and cell adhesion molecules, compiling a network for communication with the maternal blood vessels.		bEnd5 cell line;E5.5 Decidua;TGCs;bEnd5 Endothelial cells;p7;E4.75 mural Trophectoderm;E4.5 mural Trophectoderm;bEnd5 cells transfected with tdTomato;CD1;Endothelial cells E5.5 Decidua;E4.5 Embryo;B6C3F1;Trophoblast Giant Cells;Wild Type;E4.75 Embryo

Comparative interactome analyses discovered both common and virus-specific host responses and vRNA-associated proteins that variously promote or restrict viral infection. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 binds and hijacks the host factor IGF2BP1 to stabilize vRNA and augment translation. Our interactome-informed drug repurposing efforts identified several FDA-approved drugs (e.g., Cepharanthine) as broad-spectrum antivirals in cells and hACE2 mice. A co-treatment comprising Cepharanthine and Trifluoperazine was highly potent against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant. Thus, our study illustrates the scientific and medical discovery utility of adopting a comparative vRNA-host protein interactome perspective.

De novo mutations in CHD7 are the major cause of CHARGE syndrome which features multiple developmental defects. Previous studies have shown that CHD7 targets to specific genomic loci and alters local transcription potentially by remodeling the chromatin structure in a cell stage and lineage specific manner. We examined whether nuclear RNAs might contribute to its targeting and function. We used PAR-CLIP to identify a lncRNA, HERVH, that is uniquely expressed in pluripotent stem cells and preferentially interacts with CHD7. Knockdown of HERVH using LNAs or knockout of an individual copy of HERVH by CRISPR-Cas9 both resulted in increased binding of CHD7 and increased levels of H3K27ac at a subset of enhancers. Depletion of HERVH led to the activation of multiple genes, several of which might potentially poise cells towards differentiation. CHD7 bound HERVH RNA with high affinity but low specificity and that this interaction decreased the ability of CHD7 to bind and remodel nucleosomes. We present a model in which HERVH acts as a decoy to modulate the dynamics of CHD7 binding to enhancers in pluripotent cells and to prevent the activation of differentiation specific genes.

The molecular mechanisms for lineage progression in the CPM in mammals remain elusive. Here, we have used single cell RNA-seq and lineage analysis and identified a cardiopharyngeal niche containing multilineage primed cells termed multilineage progenitors (MLPs), which is maintained throughout maturation of the pharyngeal apparatus.

GSE185500	2021.10.09	Mus musculus	GPL21103	TRUE	FALSE	1	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			A Population of M2 Macrophages Associated with Bone Formation	Purpose: We had previously published that very early during bone formation we observed a very transient cell that had the phenotype of brown fat and was important in creating a hypoxic microenvironment. This is critical for cartilage formation, the first stage in bone formation. The purpose of the experiments in this manuscript were to determine the phenotype of these "brown fat" cells in more detail. Methods: To determine the phenotype of these cells they were isolated by FACS for the beta 3 adrenergic receptor that we had previously found was a good marker for these cells during bone formation. After isolation, the cells both from HO and from the callus of a fracture were subjected to single cell RNA seq. Results: The results of the single cell RNA seq showed that the cells in HO had many of the phenotypic markers of type 2 macrophages. However, they also retained the markers of brown fat including Ucp1 and Ucp2 as well as many markers of adipogenesis and extreme elevation of mitochondrial proteins. This mixture of proteins is required to burn oxygen in the microenvionment to create hypoxia. The cells made during fracture repair were further along in bone formation because they had other blood cells (B and NK cells) besides these macrophages. However, a small fraction was the same as the macrophages found during HO. Conclusions: The type 2 macrophages made during bone formation had many of the properties of type 2 macrophages in the blood. However, they were also different from macrophages found in blood in that they lacked many of the key markers of blood macrophages. These unique macrophages are made rapidly at the start of bone formation and then disappear four days later probably differentiating to osteoclasts. However, they are critical in determining where the new bone forms as well as its size and shape.

GSE185492	2021.10.09	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			RNA sequencing of gene expression in fibroblasts derived from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and control lungs	RNA sequencing has been performed to investigate the transcriptomic profile of fibroblasts derived from apical and basal regions of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and control (CTR) lungs. Lung fibroblasts were cultured onto T25 flasks until full confluence was reached. Fibroblasts were then harvested by trypsinization using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and washed in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit protocol. Samples were then sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) where 1μg of RNA was submitted for next-generation sequencing. Once raw data returned, bioinformatics analysis was conducted. Results revealed little difference at the transcriptomic level between apical lung fibroblasts isolated from IPF and CTR donors. In contrast, there was a significant difference in gene expression between IPF and CTR lung basal fibroblasts with 90 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in IPF basal fibroblasts. Gene ontology analysis of these 90 DEGs suggested that the most important functions were associated with receptor ligand activity, cell adhesion molecule binding, and integrin binding. Furthermore, fibroblasts isolated from the basal and apical sites of control lung were not significantly different. Interestingly, the lung basal fibroblasts from IPF patients were significantly different in their transcriptomic profile to that of apical fibroblasts from the same patients. 303 DEGs were identified in IPF basal fibroblasts compared with IPF apical fibroblasts. According to the GO analysis on these 303 DEGs, the most important function of the identified dysregulated genes was associated with the composition and function of the extracellular (ECM). Further pathway analysis identified 4 signaling pathways, namely arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, calcium signaling pathway, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hematopoietic cell lineage. An interesting finding was that these IPF basal fibroblasts were clustered into two groups (Group 1 and Group 2). Analysis on these two groups found 3594 DEGs in Group 1 compared to Group 2. Go analysis suggested most of the identified dysregulated genes was involved in the composition and function of the ECM. Pathway analysis identified 28 dysregulated signaling pathways, including PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, TGF-β signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway. The results of the transcriptome analysis intimate that the IPF is more predominant in the basal lungs and the fibroblast-derived from the basal region of the fibrotic lungs may serve as a central role in IPF. Moreover, the dramatic difference between two groups of IPF basal fibroblasts might be linked to the differential response to the same drug occurred in IPF patients.		lung;fibroblast;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF);apical region of lung;control donor;basal region of lung

NL4 mutation in mice causes ASD related alterations in both synaptic and behavioral phenotypes. Since microglia closely regulate synaptic development and are implicated as key players in ASD development and progression, we here studied microglial properties in the NL4-knock-out (NL4-/-) mouse model. We show that loss of NL4 caused altered behavior and impaired hippocampal gamma oscillations predominantly in male mice. In parallel, microglial density, morphology, and response to injury specifically in the CA3 region of the hippocampus were altered in NL4-/- males only. A transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed strong sexual dimorphism on molecular alterations in microglia of NL4-/-. Together, these results indicate that loss of NL4 affects not only neuronal network activity and behavior, but also changes the phenotype of microglia in a sex by genotype interaction .

Hematopoietic system is responsible for the regeneration of blood and immune cells, and is maintained by bone marrow resident hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Hematopoietic system is particularly susceptible to injury in response to genotoxic stress, resulting in risk of bone marrow failure and secondary malignancies in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Here we analyze the in vivo transcriptional response of HSPCs to genotoxic stress in a mouse whole body irradiation model, and together with p53 ChIP-Seq and studies in p53-knockout (p53KO) mice, characterize the p53-dependent and p53-independent branches of this transcriptional response. Our work demonstrates the p53-independent induction of inflammatory transcriptional signatures in HSPCs in response to genotoxic stress, and identifies multiple novel p53-target genes induced in HSPCs in response to whole body irradiation. In particular, we establish the direct p53-mediated induction of P2X7 expression on HSCs and HSPCs in response to genotoxic stress. We further demonstrate the role of P2X7 in hematopoietic response to acute genotoxic stress, with P2X7-deficiency significantly extending mouse survival in irradiation-induced hematopoietic failure. We also demonstrate the role of P2X7 in the context of long-term HSC regenerative fitness following sublethal irradiation. Overall our studies provide important insights into the mechanisms of HSC response to genotoxic stress and further suggests P2X7 as a target for pharmacological modulation of HSC fitness and hematopoietic response to genotoxic injury.		untreated;8-14 weeks of age and age-matched between groups;Cells collected 3 hours after 3Gy whole-body irradiation;FACS-sorted Lin-cKit+Sca1+CD150+ HSPCs;Trp53 homozygous knockout;Bone marrow;wildtype;B6.129S2-Trp53tm1Tyj/J (JAX 002101);C57BL/6J

In the small intestine, nutrient absorbing enterocytes operate for four days as they migrate along villi, highly graded microenvironments. Spatial transcriptomics demonstrated profound zonation in enterocyte gene expression, but how this variability translates to protein content is unclear. Here, we used spatial sorting to generate global spatial maps of enterocyte proteins and mRNAs along the villus axis. We found that both were zonated, yet often spatially anti-correlated. We developed a Bayesian approach to infer protein translation and degradation rates from the combined spatial profiles, and demonstrate that space-independent protein-synthesis delays can explain the mRNA-protein discordances. Our work provides a proteomic spatial blueprint of the intestinal epithelium and highlights the importance of protein measurements for inferring states of tissue cells that operate outside of steady state.

Calcium is a potent signaling molecule ascribed to diverse cellular processes including migration, neurotransmitter function, and cell death. Here we elucidate a crucial link between calcium homeostasis and ferroptotic cell death through the identification of the tetraspanin MS4A15. Ectopic MS4A15 expression specifically protects against ferroptosis by depleting endoplasmic reticulum stores. In an unexpected connection, prolonged calcium dysregulation stimulates fundamental remodeling to ferroptosis-resistant monounsaturated and plasmalogen lipid species. Application of this discovery revealed that augmenting luminal calcium sensitizes cancer cell lines previously refractory to ferroptosis.

GSE185467	2021.10.08	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1 enhances chemoresistance through DNA damage repair pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia by binding with RAD51	Purpose: Nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1 (NUSAP1), serves as a microtubule binding protein in chromosome separation, spindle assembly, and plays significant role to ensure normal regulation of cell cycle as well. This experiment aimed to document the NUSAP1 expression and functions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Methods: Lentivirus vectors either encoding shNUSAP1 or empty lentiviral vector were stably transfected into MEC-1 cells. 3 shNUSAP1 transfected and 3 shControl transfected MEC-1 cell samples were performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, functional enrichment analyses of gene ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Results: Silencing NUSAP1 inhibited the cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest. Mechanistically, high expression of NUSAP1 strengthened DNA damage repairing with RAD51 engagement. Our results also indicated that NUSAP1 knockdown suppressed the growth of CLL cells in vivo. Conclusion: Our research investigates the mechanism by which NUSAP1 enhances chemoresistance via DNA damage repair signaling by stabilizing RAD51 in CLL cells. Hence, NUSAP1 may be expected to be a perspective target for the treatment of CLL with chemotherapy resistance.		MEC-1;Control;NUSAP1-KD;CLL cell line

The donor had no known or suspected exposure to pertussis infection nor vaccination in the past 10 years. EDTA-blood samples for single-cell sequencing were collected at baseline and days 5 (d5), d7, d10 and d14 post-vaccination.

However, TAM depletion by CSF1R inhibition showed mixed results in clinical trials. We hypothesized that GBM subtype-specific tumor microenvironment convey distinct sensitivities to TAM targeting.We generated syngeneic PDGFB-driven and RAS-driven GBM models that resemble proneural-like and mesenchymal-like gliomas, and determined the effect of TAM targeting by CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 on glioma growth. We also investigated the co-targeting of TAMs and angiogenesis on PLX3397-resistant RAS-driven GBM. Using single-cell transcriptomic profiling, we further explored differences in tumor microenvironment cellular compositions and functions in PDGFB- and RAS-driven gliomas. We found that growth of PDGFB-driven tumors was markedly inhibited by PLX3397. In contrast, depletion of TAMs at the early phase accelerated RAS-driven tumor growth and had no effects on other proneural and mesenchymal GBM models. In addition, PLX3397-resistant RAS-driven tumors did not respond to PI3K signaling inhibition. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling revealed that PDGFB-driven gliomas induced expansion and activation of pro-tumor microglia, whereas TAMs in mesenchymal RAS-driven GBM were enriched in pro-inflammatory and angiogenic signaling. Co-targeting of TAMs and angiogenesis decreased cell proliferation and changed the morphology of RAS-driven gliomas.Our work identify functionally distinct TAM subpopulations in the growth of different glioma subtypes. Notably, we uncover a potential responsiveness of resistant mesenchymal-like gliomas to combined anti-angiogenic therapy and CSF1R inhibition. These data highlight the importance of characterization of the microenvironment landscape in order to optimally stratify patients for TAM-targeted therapy.		untreated;Vehicle;Boy/J;Mouse Brain Tumor;Cd11b+ TAMs;Brain Tumor;PLX3397;Brain Tumor Cells
GSE185371	2021.10.08	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			RNA-seq analysis of HIV-1 gp120 stimulated, p38α knockout and wild-type microglia isolated from mouse brain.	Purpose: The goals of this study is to compare transcriptome profiles of microglia from different mouse genotypes using RNA-seq analysis. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occur in about 50% of infected individuals. Transgenic mice expressing the soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 in astroglia (HIVgp120tg) display key neuropathological features of NeuroHIV patients (Toggas et al., 1994; Maung et al., 2014; Ojeda-Juarez et al., 2020). Here we show that microglial p38α MAPK plays a crucial role in neuronal injury triggered in vivo by the viral envelope glycoprotein. Cre-expression driven by the CX3CR1 promotor in HIVgp120tg mice carrying floxed alleles of p38a MAPK results in deletion of p38α in microglia and complete protection against neuronal injury and loss. RNA-seq analysis of microglia indicates that p38α deficiency leads to upregulation of neuroprotective and downregulation of neurotoxic factors. The expression patterns of genes associated with neurotransmission differ between brains protected from neuronal injury in the presence of transgenic gp120 and non-transgenic controls, suggesting a non-toxic modulation of neurons by the viral protein and microglial p38α deficiency.

GSE185322	2021.10.08	Homo sapiens	GPL18573	TRUE	FALSE	44	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Gene expression analysis under normal and stress conditions during in-vitro embryo development and subanalysis of gene expression in the blastocyst stage according to its Mitoscore®.	We analyzed the differences in the gene expression profile, especially pathways related to mitochondrial activity, between human embryos of different developmental stages, different Mitoscore® values and under stress conditions such as embryo arrest and the vitrification/warming process. In total, 44 vitrified specimens were collected for RNA-seq analysis, including 11 MII oocytes, 10 non-arrested cleavage-stage embryos, 5 arrested cleavage-stage embryos and 18 blastocysts (10 blastocysts cultured for 4-5 hours after warming and 8 blastocysts cultured for 0 hours after warming). All specimens were warmed and whole sampled in PCR tubes with 2 μL of 10× Reaction Buffer (SMART-Seq v4 Ultra-Low Input RNA kit for Sequencing, Takara Bio, USA). Amplified cDNA obtained from mRNA was purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Illumina, CA, USA). Libraries were constructed using NexteraXT DNA sample preparation (Illumina, CA, USA) and sequencing was done in duplicate in a total of four runs using an Illumina NextSeq 500 (Illumina, CA, USA) with a 300-nucleotide read length in a paired-end design (150-bp fragments). FastQC was used for checking the quality of the raw sequence data. Those fragments that did not meet quality requirements were trimmed using Trimmomatic. Alignment and quantification were performed using the Salmon algorithm (reference genome GRCh38). We observed that disruption of normal in-vitro culture and high Mitoscore® values are related to an upregulation of cellular stress pathways in human embryos. Despite the crucial role of mitochondria in cellullar stress, an upregulation of mitochondrial activity pathways is only observed during embryo arrest.

GSE185311	2021.10.08	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	22	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Modulation of the human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma immune microenvironment by stereotactic body radiotherapy	Purpose: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging treatment modality for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that can effectively prime cytotoxic T cells by inducing immunogenic tumor cell death in preclinical models. SBRT effects on human PDAC have yet to be thoroughly investigated, therefore, this study aimed to characterize immunomodulation in the human PDAC tumor microenvironment following therapy. Experimental Design: Tumor samples were obtained from patients with resectable PDAC. Radiotherapy was delivered a median of seven days prior to surgical resection, and sections were analyzed by multiplex IHC (mIHC), RNA-Seq, and T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-Seq). Results: Analysis of SBRT-treated tumor tissue indicated reduced tumor cell density and increased immunogenic cell death relative to untreated controls. Radiotherapy promoted collagen deposition, however, vasculature was unaffected and spatial analyses lacked evidence of T cell sequestration. Conversely, SBRT resulted in fewer tertiary lymphoid structures and failed to lessen or reprogram abundant immune suppressor populations. Higher percentages of PD-1+ T cells were observed following SBRT, and a subset of tumors displayed more clonal T cell repertoires. Conclusions: These findings suggest that SBRT augmentation of antitumor immunogenicity may be dampened by an overabundance of refractory immunosuppressive populations, and support the continued development of SBRT/immunotherapy combination for human PDAC.		untreated;resectable PDAC; whole tissue;SBRT;patients with resectable PDAC;FFPE tissue section from resection;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

Materials and methods: The SCI model was firstly built in mice, which were randomly divided into three groups: Sham (SH), SCI and HBO groups, followed by hind limb motor function evaluation. Then the spinal cord tissue samples were harvested for histological evaluation and genome-wide transcriptional analysis at 1 week after injury. Finally, some oxidative stress and cell death related differently expressed genes were selected to be analyzed followed by the functional analysis. Results: HBO treatment significantly improved the recovery of hind limb motor function and decreased the histology score compared to the SCI group. In the genome-wide transcriptional analysis, a total of 76 common differently expressed gene among the three groups were obtained at 1 week after injury, which were enriched in functional pathway such as ferroptosis, calcium signaling pathway, serotonergic synapse, etc. Trends in expression of the six genes were consistent with transcriptional analysis. Conclusions: Identified differentially expressed genes and related signaling pathways may be associated with HBO treatment alleviating second spinal cord injury. These results contribute to elucidate the mechanism of HBO in the treatment of SCI.		7-9 weeks;no injury;wild type;spinal cord;injury;HBO treatment;C57BL/6

GSE185253	2021.10.08	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			In vivo single-cell and bulk transcriptomics reveals murine Leishmania major infection drives a pro-inflammatory signature alongside a signature of decreased ribosomal biogenesis.	Leishmania parasites cause cutaneous leishmanina (CL), a pathologic disease characterized by disfiguring, ulcerative skin lesions. Both parasite and host gene expression following infection with various Leishmania species has been investigated in vitro, but global transcriptional analysis following L. major infection in vivo is lacking. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic profiling study combining bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to identify global changes in gene expression in vivo following L. major infection. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis revealed that host immune response pathways like the antigen processing and presentation pathway were significantly enriched amongst differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon infection, while ribosomal pathways were significantly downregulated in infected mice compared to naive controls. scRNA-Seq analyses revealed cellular heterogeneity including distince resident and recruitment cell types in the skin following L. major infection. Within the individual immune cell types, several DEGs indicative of many interferon induced GTPases and antigen presentation molecules were significantly enhanced in the infected ears including macrophages (H2-K1, H2-D1, Gbp4, Gbp8, Gbp2), and inflammatory monocytes (Gbp2, Gbp5, Gbp7, Gbp3). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of scRNA-Seq data indicated the antigen presentation pathway was increased with infection, while EIF2 signaling is the top downregulated pathway followed by eIF4/p70S6k and mTOR signaling in multiple cell types including macrophages, BECs, and LECs. Altogether, this transcriptomic profile highlights known recruitment of myeloid cells to lesions and recognizes a previously undefined role for EIF2 signaling in murine L. major infection in vivo.

Methods: Patients with SLE (185) with moderate to severe disease activity and positive interferon (IFN) gene signature were randomised to receive IFN-K or PBO intramuscular injections (days 0, 7 and 28 and W12 and W24). Coprimary endpoints at W36 were neutralisation of IFN gene signature and the BILAG-Based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) modified by mandatory corticosteroid (CS) tapering. Results: IFN-K induced neutralising anti-IFN-α2b serum antibodies in 91% of treated patients and reduce the IFN gene signature (p<0.0001). Modified BICLA responses at W36 did not statistically differ between IFN-K (41%) and PBO (34%). Trends on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index-4, including steroid tapering at W36, favoured the IFN- K and became significant (p<0.05) in analyses restricted to patients who developed neutralising anti-IFN-α2b antibodies. Attainment of lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS) at W36 discriminated the two groups in favour of IFN-K (53% vs. 30%, p=0.0022). A significant CS sparing effect of IFN-K was observed from W28 onwards, with a 24% prednisone daily dose reduction at W36 in IFN-K compared with PBO (p=0.0097). The safety profile of IFN-K was acceptable. Conclusions: IFN-K induced neutralising anti-IFN-α2b antibodies and significantly reduced the IFN gene signature with an acceptable safety profile. Although the clinical coprimary endpoint was not met, relevant secondary endpoints were achieved in the IFN-K group, including attainment of LLDAS and steroid tapering.

GSE176039	2021.10.08	Mus musculus	GPL17021	TRUE	FALSE	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			RNA-seq of 25OHC-treated CD4+ T cells	IL-27 is an immunoregulatory cytokine whose essential function is to limit immune responses. We found that the gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) was induced in CD4+ T cells by IL-27, enhanced by TGF-β, and antagonized by T-bet. Ch25h catalyzes cholesterol to generate 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC), which was subsequently released to the cellular milieu, functioning as a modulator of T cell response. Extracellular 25OHC suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis in T cells, inhibited cell growth, and induced nutrient-deprivation cell death without releasing high-mobility group box-1. This growth inhibitory effect was specific to actively proliferating cells with high cholesterol demand and was reversed when extracellular cholesterol was replenished. Interestingly, Ch25h expressing CD4+ T cells that received IL-27 and TGF-β signals became refractory to 25OHC-mediated growth inhibition in vitro. Nonetheless, IL-27 treated T cells negatively affected viability of bystander cells in a paracrine manner, but only if the bystander cells were in the early phases of activation. In mouse models of skin inflammation due to autoreactive T cells or chemically induced hypersensitivity, genetic deletion of Ch25h or Il27ra led to worsened outcomes. Thus, Ch25h is an immunoregulatory metabolic switch induced by IL-27 and dampens excess bystander T effector expansion in tissues through its metabolite derivative, 25OHC.

Gain-of-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA are the initiating event in most of the cases and KIT oncogenic signaling is essential throughout all the disease. Interestingly, KIT oncogenic signaling is driven by PI3K/mTOR and RAS/MAPK pathways regardless of KIT primary or secondary mutations. Hence, dissection of KIT-downstream pathways may result in the identification of novel KIT critical effectors and a new opportunity to overcome disease heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms in GIST. Using human clinically representative GIST cell models, we undertook pharmacological and functional screenings such as Cell titer glo, kinase activation, apoptosis induction and proliferation to identify key signaling nodes within PI3K/mTOR and RAS/MAPK pathways. In vitro and in vivo validations were undertaken to model novel therapeutic strategies. Transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) found essential genes co-regulated by both pathways. Functional studies, such as immunofluorescence, kinase activation, flow cytometry and proliferation were performed on a viral gene overexpression and knock-down models to elucidate their regulation and potential role in GIST biology. PI3K/mTOR and MEK1/2 are the most essential KIT-downstream mediators. Single node inhibition did not yield sustained antiproliferative and apoptotic effect, but simultaneous intermittent ablation was synergistic in vitro and in vivo, supporting the critical role of these two pathways.Transcriptomic analyses underscored FBXO32 (a SCF E3 ubiquitin-ligase and the main effector of muscular atrophy) as the most differentially expressed gene co-regulated by PI3K/mTOR and RAS/MAPK pathways. Functional studies demonstrated that FBXO32 is transcriptionally activated by FOXO3a which, in turn, is regulated by PI3K/mTOR and RAS/MAPK pathways. Notoriously, FBXO32 proved to have a pro-survival role in GIST cells. Microarray studies hinted a participation of FBXO32 in cell cycle arrest, which has been previously described as an adaptive pro-survival mechanism in GIST cells. This mechanism was further confirmed by functional studies. Remarkably, FBXO32 was expressed upon KIT inhibition in a panel of GIST cell lines, regardless the mutational status of KIT, and in a gene set database from GIST patients treated with first-line treatment, imatinib. PI3K/mTOR and MEK1/2 are the critical mediators of KIT oncogenic signaling in GIST, and their intermittent co-inhibition is an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic strategy to treat GIST tumors, independently of their KIT mutational status. FBXO32 emerges as a common mediator of KIT-downstream PI3K/mTOR and RAS/MAPK pathways with a critical pro-survival role in GIST participating in cell cycle arrest as pro-survival mechanism.

The commitment of hematopoietic multipotent progenitors (MPPs) towards a particular lineage involves activation of cell-type-specific genes and silencing of genes that promote alternate cell fates. Although the gene expression programs of early-B and early-T lymphocyte development are mutually exclusive, we show these cell types exhibit significantly correlated microRNA profiles. However, their corresponding miRNA-targetomes are distinct and predominated by transcripts associated with NK, DC, and myeloid lineages, suggesting miRNAs function in a cell-autonomous manner. Combinatorial expression of microRNAs: miR-186-5p, miR-128-3p, and miR-330-5p in MPPs significantly attenuate their myeloid differentiation potential due to the repression of myeloid-associated transcripts. Depletion of these miRNAs caused a pronounced de-repression of myeloid lineage targets in differentiating early-B and early-T cells, resulting in a mixed-lineage gene expression pattern. De novo motif analysis combined with an assay of promoter activities indicate that B, as well as T lineage determinants, drive the expression of these miRNAs in lymphoid lineages. Collectively, we present a paradigm that miRNAs are conserved between developing B and T lymphocytes, yet they target distinct sets of promiscuously-expressed lineage-inappropriate genes to suppress alternate cell-fate options. Thus, our studies provide a comprehensive compendium of miRNAs with functional implications for B and T lymphocyte development.

While NAD+ also participates in redox reactions, the extent to which NAD(H) couples nutrient state with circadian transcriptional cycles remains unknown. Here we show that nocturnal animals subjected to time-restricted feeding of a calorie-restricted diet (TRF-CR) only during nighttime display reduced body temperature and elevated hepatic NADH during daytime. Genetic uncoupling of nutrient state from NADH redox state through transduction of the water-forming NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbNOX) increases daytime body temperature and blood and liver acyl-carnitines. LbNOX expression in TRF-CR mice induces oxidative gene networks controlled by BMAL1 and PPARa and suppresses amino acid catabolic pathways. Enzymatic analyses reveal that NADH inhibits SIRT1 in vitro, corresponding with reduced deacetylation of SIRT1 substrates during TRF-CR in vivo. Remarkably, Sirt1 liver nullizygous animals subjected to TRF-CR display persistent hypothermia even when NADH is oxidized by LbNOX. Our findings reveal that the hepatic NADH cycle links nutrient state to whole-body energetics through the rhythmic regulation of SIRT1.

Microarray analysis of the GSCs before or after depletion of ALDH1A3 provides important information to determine the genes regulated by ALDH1A3 in the mesenchymal subtype of GSCs.

Mycoplasma genitalium and M. pneumoniae are two significant mycoplasmas that infect the urogenital and respiratory tracts of humans. Despite distinct tissue tropisms, they both have similar pathogenic mechanisms and infect/invade epithelial cells in the respective regions and persist within these cells. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of these species in terms of bacterium-host interactions are poorly understood. To gain insights on this, we infected HeLa cells independently with M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae and assessed gene expression by whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. The results revealed that HeLa cells respond to M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae differently by regulating various protein-coding genes. Though there is a significant overlap between the genes regulated by these species, many of the differentially expressed genes were specific to each species. KEGG pathway and signaling network analyses revealed that the genes specific to M. genitalium are more related to cellular processes. In contrast, the genes specific to M. pneumoniae infection are correlated with immune response and inflammation, possibly suggesting that M. pneumoniae has some inherent ability to modulate host immune pathways.

We found that the gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) was induced in CD4+ T cells by IL-27, enhanced by TGF-β, and antagonized by T-bet. Ch25h catalyzes cholesterol to generate 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC), which was subsequently released to the cellular milieu, functioning as a modulator of T cell response. Extracellular 25OHC suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis in T cells, inhibited cell growth, and induced nutrient-deprivation cell death without releasing high-mobility group box-1. This growth inhibitory effect was specific to actively proliferating cells with high cholesterol demand and was reversed when extracellular cholesterol was replenished. Interestingly, Ch25h expressing CD4+ T cells that received IL-27 and TGF-β signals became refractory to 25OHC-mediated growth inhibition in vitro. Nonetheless, IL-27 treated T cells negatively affected viability of bystander cells in a paracrine manner, but only if the bystander cells were in the early phases of activation. In mouse models of skin inflammation due to autoreactive T cells or chemically induced hypersensitivity, genetic deletion of Ch25h or Il27ra led to worsened outcomes. Thus, Ch25h is an immunoregulatory metabolic switch induced by IL-27 and dampens excess bystander T effector expansion in tissues through its metabolite derivative, 25OHC. This study reveals regulation of cholesterol metabolism as a modality for controlling tissue inflammation and thus represents a mechanism underlying T cell immunoregulatory functions.		cultured in plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml each) in combination with 20 ng/ml IL-12 and 10 μg/ml anti-IL-4 antibody (11B.11).;cultured in plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml each) in combination with 20 ng/ml TGF-β, 50 U/ml IL-2, and anti-IFN-γ antibody.;cultured in plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml each) in combination with 2 ng/ml TGF-β, 20 ng/ml IL-6, anti-IFN-γ, and 10 μg/ml anti-IL-2 antibody (S4B6).;Naive CD4+ T cells (CD4+CD62LhiCD44loCD25- cells);cultured in plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml each) in combination with 20 ng/ml IL-1β, 20 ng/ml IL-6, 50 ng/ml IL-23, anti-IFN-γ, anti-IL-2, 5 μg/ml anti-TGF-β1 (R&D Systems), and 5 μg/ml anti-TGF-β2/1.2 antibody (R&D Systems).;cultured in plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml each) in combination with anti-IFN-γ, anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-2 antibody.;CD4+ T cells;cultured in plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml each) in combination with 20 ng/ml IL-27, 2 ng/ml TGF-β, anti-IFN-γ, anti-IL-2, and anti-IL-4 20 ng/ml IL-27, 2 ng/ml TGF-β, anti-IFN-γ, anti-IL-2, and anti-IL-4 antibody.;C57BL/6;cultured in plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml each) in combination with 20 ng/ml IL-4 and 10 μg/ml anti-IFN-γ antibody (XMG1.2).

Here we characterize the role of Krüppel-Like Factor 5 (KLF5), in controlling essential pathways of epithelial cell identity and function in the human lung. RNA-seq following siRNA-mediated depletion of KLF5 in the Calu-3 lung epithelial cell line identified significant enrichment of genes encoding chemokines and cytokines involved in the proinflammatory response, and also components of the junctional complexes mediating cell adhesion. To determine direct gene targets of KLF5, we defined the cistrome of KLF5 using ChIP-seq in both Calu-3 and 16HBE14o- lung epithelial cells lines. Occupancy site concordance analysis revealed that KLF5 co-localized with the active histone modification H3K27ac and also with binding sites for CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Beta (C/EBPβ). Depletion of KLF5 increased both the expression and secretion of important chemokines, a response that was enhanced following exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide. Wound scratch assays in Calu-3 cells exhibited faster rates of repair after KLF5 depletion than did negative controls. Similarly, CRISPR-mediated KLF5-null 16HBE14o- cells also showed enhanced wound closure. These data reveal a pivotal role for KLF5 in coordinating epithelial functions relevant to human lung disease.		Calu3 KLF5 KD;Calu3 Negative Control;Calu-3;Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line

Keratinocytes of low passage (p2-4) were cultured onto T25 flasks until full confluence was reached. Keratinocytes were then harvested by trypsinization using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and washed in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit protocol. Samples were then sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) where 1μg of RNA was submitted for next-generation sequencing. Once raw data returned, bioinformatics analyses were conducted. Through RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis, 252 differentially expressed genes were identified in keloid keratinocytes compared to normal skin keratinocytes. Further gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that changes in tight junctions and dysregulated response to viral infection were associated with keloid epithelia and may be linked to the disease. The results of the transcriptome analysis intimate that keloid derived keratinocytes exhibit an abnormal gene expression profile and the abnormalities in keloid keratinocytes may have an important role in keloid pathogenesis.		keloid;keratinocyte;keloid tissue;skin;control donor;normal skin tissue

Both beneficial and detrimental functions are attributed to ERVs, but whether ERVs contribute to antiviral immunity is not well studied. Here, we used herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection as a model and found that mice deficient in Toll-like receptor 7 (Tlr7-/-) that have high systemic levels of infectious ERVs are resistant to intravaginal HSV-2 infection, compared with wildtype C57BL/6 (B6) mice. We deleted the endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus (Emv2) locus on the Tlr7-/- background (Emv2-/-Tlr7-/-) and found that Emv2-/-Tlr7-/- mice lose protection against HSV-2 infection. Intravaginal application of purified ERVs prior to HSV-2 infection delays disease in both B6 and highly susceptible interferon-alpha receptor-deficient (Ifnar1-/-) mice. We did not observe enhanced type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in the vaginal tissues from Tlr7-/- mice or B6 mice treated with purified ERVs, and instead found enrichment in genes associated with extracellular matrix organization. Together, our results revealed an IFN-independent modulation of the vaginal epithelium by ERVs that protects mice against vaginal HSV-2 infection and delays disease.		uninfected;vagina;wild type B6;Emv2KO;HSV-2 186 Syn+;TLR7KO;Emv2TLR7dKO

As an obligate intracellular parasite, Cryptosporidium relies on intestinal epithelial cells to provide a niche for its growth and survival, but little is known about the contributions that the infected cell makes to this relationship. Here we conducted a genome wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen to discover host genes required for Cryptosporidium parvum infection and/or host cell survival. The gene enrichment analysis indicated that the host interferon response, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis are important determinants of susceptibility to C. parvum infection. Several of these pathways are linked to parasite attachment and invasion and C-type lectins on the surface of the parasite. Evaluation of transcript and protein induction of innate interferons revealed a pronounced type III interferon response to Cryptosporidium in human cells as well as in mice. Treatment of mice with IFNλ reduced infection burden and protected immunocompromised mice from severe outcomes including death, with effects that STAT1 signaling in the enterocyte. Initiation of this type III interferon response was dependent on sustained intracellular growth and mediated by the pattern recognition receptor TLR3. We conclude that host cell intrinsic recognition of Cryptosporidium results in IFNλ production critical to early protection against this infection.

Recent studies have shown that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a type of RNA modification, is strongly associated with many important biological processes. However, the relationship between m6A methylation modifications and NAFLD remains poorly understood. In the present study, through methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA transcriptome sequencing in high fructose diet-induced NAFLD mice, we found that hypermethylation-encoding genes were mainly enriched in lipid metabolism processes. We identified 266 overlapping and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that changed at both the mRNA expression level and m6A modification level. Among them, 193 genes displayed increased expression and m6A modification, indicating that m6A RNA modifications tend to be positively correlated with NAFLD. We further compared the high fructose diet-induced NAFLD mouse model with leptin receptor-deficient mice and found that DEGs enriched in the lipid metabolism pathway were up-regulated in both groups. In contrast, DEGs associated with the immune inflammatory response were up-regulated in the high fructose diet group, but down-regulated in leptin receptor-deficient mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that m6A methylation modifications may play an important role in the development of NAFLD.		untreated;db/db;liver;C57BL/6

We also evaluated the ability of hedgehog inhibitor (HHi) therapy to reverse CA-MSC effects. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were cultured with 2F8cis, an ovarian mouse tumor cell line, to generate cancer-associated MSC (CA-MSC). 2F8cis tumor cell alone or 2F8cis/CA-MSCs co-cultured cells at ratio 1:1 were injected into C57BL/6J mice. Tumor infiltrating CD45+ cells were isolated from anti-PD-L1-treated 2F8cis (Group 1, n=3), anti-PD-L1-treated 2F8cis/CA-MSCs (Group 2, n=3), anti-PD-L1+ IPI-926-treated 2F8cis/CA-MSCs (Group 3, n=3) tumors. Samples were labeled with different TotalSeq oligo-conjugated antibodies and loaded into the Chromium instrument (10x Genomics). The resulting barcoded cDNAs were used to construct libraries. Single-cell cDNA libraries were then processed for RNA sequencing using an Illumina NextSeq-500 platform. Anti-PD-L1-treated 2F8cis/CA-MSC tumors showed a high number of Monocytes and macrophages over-expressing Ccr2 and Tgfbi when compared to anti-PD-L1 responsive 2F8cis tumors. Our results also indicated that IPI-926 restored response to anti-PD-L1 therapy decresing the expression of Ccr2 and Tgfbi both in monocytes and macrophages. Our study represents the first detailed analysis generated by RNA-seq technology of 2F8cis/CA-MSC+ enriched tumor transcriptomes, treated with anti-PDL1 alone or in combination with HHi, and compared with anti-PDL1-treated tumors. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles.		CD45+ cells from ovarian tumor;Ovarian;C57BL/6

Better elucidating the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and aggressiveness is important for improving the therapeutic efficiencies of NB. Through mining of public datasets, we identified circular RNA derived from CUX1 exons (ecircCUX1) as a novel driver of NB progression. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic functions of ecircCUX1, we employed the BGIseq500 as a discovery platform to analyze the transcriptome profiling changes of human SH-SY5Y cells in response to stable over-expression of ecircCUX1. The results showed that stable over-expression of ecircCUX1 led to altered expression of 2155 human mRNAs, including 460 up-regulated and 1695 down-regulated genes. Then, we found the possible roles of these differentially regulated mRNAs in selected pathways including lipid metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial complex I activity, invasion, and metastasis by Bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, we validated the RNA-seq results by real-time RT-PCR with high identity. Overall, our results provided fundamental information about the transcriptomic changes in response to ecircCUX1 over-expression in human NB cells, and these findings will help us understand the pathogenesis of NB.

To systematically obtain complete single neuron morphology on a brain-wide scale, we established a platform with five major components: sparse labeling, whole-brain imaging, reconstruction, registration, and classification. We fully reconstructed 1,741 neurons from cortex, claustrum, thalamus, striatum and other brain regions. We identify 11 major projection neuron types with distinct morphological features and corresponding transcriptomic identities. We further reveal extensive morphological diversity within each of these major types, some of which cluster into more refined morphological subtypes. We analyze this diversity at different levels following a set of generalizable organizational rules governing long-range axonal projections, including molecular correspondence, divergent or convergent projection, axon termination pattern, regional specificity, topography, and individual cell variability. We illustrate how these rules manifest in different projection neuron types. Although clear concordance with transcriptomic profiles is evident at major projection type level, fine-grained morphological diversity often does not readily correlate with transcriptomic subtypes derived from unsupervised clustering, highlighting the need for single-cell level cross-modality studies. Overall, our study provides a systematic demonstration of the crucial need for quantitative description of complete single cell anatomy in cell type classification, as the cell type-specific morphological diversity reveals a plethora of ways different cell types and individual neurons may contribute to the function of their respective circuits.

GSE181022	2021.10.06	Homo sapiens	GPL13667	TRUE	TRUE	70	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Newborn infant skin gene expression: Remarkable differences versus adults	At birth, human infants are poised to survive in harsh, hostile conditions. An understanding of the state of newborn skin development and maturation is key to the maintenance of health, optimum response to injury, healing and disease. The observational study collected full-thickness newborn skin samples from 27 infants at surgery and compared them to skin samples from 43 adult sites protected from ultraviolet radiation exposure, as the standard for stable, mature skin. Transcriptomics profiling and gene set enrichment analysis were performed. Statistical analysis established over 25,000 differentially regulated probe sets, representing 10,647 distinct genes, in infant skin compared to adult skin. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a significant increase in 143 biological processes (adjusted p < 0.01) in infant skin, versus adult skin samples, including extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, cell adhesion, collagen fibril organization and fatty acid metabolic process. The top two biological processes were ECM organization and ECM structure organization. Genes involving epidermis development, immune function, cell differentiation, and hair cycle were overexpressed in adults, representing 101 significantly enriched biological processes (adjusted p < 0.01). The top processes involved skin and epidermal development, e.g., keratinocyte differentiation, keratinization and cornification intermediate filament cytoskeleton organization and hair cycle. Over half of the enriched biological processes also involved immune function, including antigen processing and presentation. The results provide essential insight regarding newborn infant skin and its ability to support the newborn’s preparedness to survive and flourish, despite the infant’s new environment laden with microbes, high oxygen tension and potential irritants. To our knowledge, this is the first report on newborn infant skin transcriptomics analysis. When compared to ultraviolet radiation protected adult skin, it highlights the substantial differences between them. This fundamental knowledge is expected to guide strategies to protect and preserve the features of unperturbed, young skin.		62 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;89.1 week;89.1 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;20 year;37.5 week;36.8 week Baby chest Male skin biopsy sample;39.5 week;Male;S0115;40.2 week Baby chest Female skin biopsy sample;37.2 week Baby head Female skin biopsy sample;64 year;45 week;S0078;40.8 week Baby chest Female skin biopsy sample;40.2 week;S0113;21 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;43.2 week;Buttocks;42.1 week;S0060;36.3 week Baby back Female skin biopsy sample;35.9 week Baby scrotum Male skin biopsy sample;50.4 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;36.3 week;S0106;39.4 week;63 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;S0184;S0063;S0185;S0186;S0188;39.7 week;30.7 week Baby back Male skin biopsy sample;37.2 week;61 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;42.3 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;23 year;39.4 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;38.8 week;66.3 week Baby abdomen Female skin biopsy sample;22 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;S0017;34.3 week;S0019;63 year;22 year;34.3 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;Female;S0010;35.9 week;S0131;S0011;S0133;S0012;S0013;S0014;43.2 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;50.4 week;42.6 week;42.3 week;60 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;S0009;36.1 week;64 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;37.5 week Baby back Female skin biopsy sample;S0003;42.6 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;scrotum;23 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;40.8 week;S0038;40.9 week;60 year;S0152;40.9 week Baby chest Female skin biopsy sample;S0155;S0156;S0035;S0158;chest;39.5 week Baby abdomen Female skin biopsy sample;61 year;38.8 week Baby back Male skin biopsy sample;S0027;S0148;S0028;38.7 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;36.1 week Baby chest Female skin biopsy sample;S0140;Skin;S0142;40.9 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;S0022;S0143;S0144;S0025;36.2 week;36.2 week Baby chest Male skin biopsy sample;abdomen;S0050;S0051;S0172;back;36.8 week;24 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;head;42.1 week Baby chest Female skin biopsy sample;S0057;39.7 week Baby back Female skin biopsy sample;66.3 week;30.7 week;20 year Adult Buttocks Female skin biopsy sample;45 week Baby abdomen Male skin biopsy sample;21 year;38.7 week;24 year;S0162;S0044;S0045;62 year
GSE180282	2021.10.06	Homo sapiens	GPL11154	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE		34312968	VprBP directs epigenetic gene silencing through H2A phosphorylation in colon cancer	Histone modification is aberrantly regulated in cancer and generates an unbalanced state of gene transcription. VprBP, a recently identified kinase, phosphorylates histone H2A on threonine 120 (T120) and is involved in oncogenic transcriptional dysregulation; however, its specific role in colon cancer is undefined. Here we show that VprBP is overexpressed in colon cancer and directly contributes to epigenetic gene silencing and cancer pathogenesis. Mechanistically, the observed function of VprBP is mediated through H2AT120 phosphorylation (H2AT120p)-driven transcriptional repression of growth regulatory genes, resulting in a significantly higher proliferative capacity of colon cancer cells. Our preclinical studies using organoid and xenograft models demonstrate that treatment with VprBP inhibitor B32B3 impairs colonic tumor growth by blocking H2AT120p and reactivating transcriptional program resembling that of normal cells. Collectively, our work describes VprBP as a master kinase contributing to the development and progression of colon cancer, making it a new molecular target for novel therapeutic strategies.		shControl;shVprBP;Colon cancer cell line (SW620)-Scrambled;VprBP-knocked down colon cancer cell line (SW620);SW620
GSE179994	2021.10.06	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	47	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Temporal single cell tracing reveals clonal revival and expansion of precursor exhausted T cells during anti-PD-1 therapy in lung cancer	Immune-checkpoint therapies have shown unprecedented clinical success in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, but the underlying mechanisms of anti-PD-1–induced tumour rejection remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed temporal single-cell RNA and paired T cell receptor sequencing on 47 clinical tumour biopsies from 36 non-small-cell lung cancer patients before and during combination therapies of PD-1 blockade with chemotherapy. We found that the treatment in responsive tumours preferentially increased the precursors of exhausted T cells (Tex), characterized by the low expression of co-inhibitory molecules and high expression of GZMK. By contrast, non-responsive tumours failed to accumulate Tex precursors (Texp), suggestive of the critical role of such cells in PD-1-based immunotherapies. Although these post-treatment Texp cells shared clonotypes extensively with terminal Tex subset prior to treatment, our data suggested that they were not derived from the reinvigoration of terminal Tex cells; instead, such Texp cells were likely accumulated by (i) the expansion of pre-existing Texp cells, and (ii) the replenishment with peripheral T cells, a phenomenon we named clonal revival. Furthermore, post-treatment Texp cells expressed high level of CXCL13, which was exclusively expressed by terminal Tex subset in treatment-naïve tumours, implying that the emergence of CXCL13-expressing Texp cells resulted from the blockade of the transition to terminal Tex cells by PD-1 antibodies. Our study provides new insights into mechanisms underlying PD-1-based therapies, implicating both clonal revival and expansion of Texp cells as steps to enhance the clinical response of lung cancer patients.

Obesity increased tumor growth rate and tumor burden. Fewer immune cells were present in tumors from obese mice, and the T cells had an activated and exhausted phenotype. Macrophages in obese animals had decreased expression of iNOS2 and MHCII, supporting a weaker “M1” anti-tumor phenotype compared to lean mice. When treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies, however, obese mice had a greater absolute decrease in tumor burden than lean mice. PD-1 blockade repolarized the macrophages to an M1-phentoype in obese mice, but this did not occur in the lean mice. Mechanistically, leptin is a pro-inflammatory adipokine that is increased in obesity and may mediate enhanced anti-tumor immunity in obesity.  To test the effect of leptin on tumor growth and anti-tumor immunity, lean mice were treated with leptin and tumors were observed over time. Leptin had single-agent preventative and therapeutic anti-tumor efficacy similar to PD-1 checkpoint therapy.  These data demonstrate that obesity has dual effects in cancer through promotion of tumor cell initiation while also enhancing anti-tumor immunity through elevated levels of leptin that can reprogram inflammatory macrophages. 		45% fat;tumor;Mouse xenograft models;10% fat;C57BL/6;male

To investigate whether adropin administered also regulates the brain transcriptome, RNA seq was used in 18-month-old male B6 mice treated with synthetic peptide at a dose previously shown to be effective. Mice were split into two weight matched groups, acclimated to handling and then treated with peptide (90 nmol/kg/d) suspended in 0.9% saline plus 0.1% BSA over 4 weeks. Controls were treated with diluent; injections were given daily at 0900h. Applying a cut-off using a fold-change (FC) >1.5 and a p-value of <0.05 identified a small number of responsive genes (84 upregulated, 172 downregulated). Gene enrichment analysis indicated that peptide treatment primarily changed the expression of genes involved in tissue morphogenesis (e.g. “pattern specification process”, “embryo development”, “animal morphogenesis”). Possibly related to increases in cellular proliferation and differentiation, there was also evidence for increases in large molecule synthesis. For example, RNA metabolism (“positive regulation of RNA biosynthetic process”; “positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II”) and ‘macromolecule synthesis” were affected by treatment.

Then, we selected those genes that were significantly deregulated 1.4-fold higher (FDR<0.05) and have an EntrezID code. As a result, we formulate a transcriptional signature associated with defective decidualization composed by 120 genes.

Shank2-mutant mice with a homozygous deletion of exons 6 and 7 show decreased NMDA receptor (NMDAR) functions and autistic-like behaviors in juvenile (~postnatal day or P21) and adult (> P56) stages that are rescued by NMDAR activation. These mice, however, show an opposite change increased NMDAR functions—at ~P14, and NMDAR suppression by early and chronic memantine treatment during P7–21 prevents NMDAR hypofunction and autistic-like behaviors at juvenile (~P21) and adult (~P56) stages. To explore molecular mechanisms underlying the long-lasting effects of early memantine treatment, we performed RNA-Seq analysis of forebrains from wild-type and Shank2-mutant mice early and chronically treated with vehicle or memantine. Memantine-treated Shank2-mutant mice showed upregulations of chromatin-related genes and downregulations of mitochondria- and ribosome-related genes. In addition, vehicle-treated Shank2-mutant mice showed transcriptomic patterns that are largely opposite to those observed in ASD, as supported by the expression patterns of ASD-risk/related genes and cell-type-specific genes. These patterns, likely representing compensatory changes, were weakened by early memantine treatment. These results suggest that early chronic memantine treatment in Shank2-mutant mice alters chromatin- and mitochondria/ribosome-related gene expressions and weakens anti-ASD transcriptomic patterns.

Disruption of ER proteostasis leads to ER stress, which subsequently activates multiple adaptive stress response pathways, collectedly termed as the unfolded protein response (UPR). One UPR branch is mediated by ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6). Activation of the ATF6 branch generates a transcriptional factor: short form ATF6 (sATF6). Since activation of this UPR branch has been shown to be neuroprotective in brain ischemia/stroke, it is critical to identify what genes are regulated by the sATF6 in neurons in vivo and determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects exerted by this UPR branch.

However, the regulation mechanism of HSP70 in cardiac hypertrophy is unknown. In this study, we established the cardiac hypertrophy mouse model to explore the differentially expressed genes and found Hspa1a was significantly increased in treated samples. Then Hspa1a was overexpressed in mouse cardiac HL-1 cells and we analyzed the changes of transcriptome expression by high throughput sequencing. The results showed that HSPA1A selectively regulates the expression of ncRNAs (Rn7sk,Rmrp), negatively regulates the expression of genes involved in inflammatory and immune response, including Cxcl1，Ccl2，Ccl7,Cxcl5, Fas andC3, which were also validated by RT-qPCR experiment. The HSPA1A-regulated genes and ncRNAs are highly associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Alternative splicing analysis revealed HSPA1A preferred to regulate genes enriched in transcriptional regulation, including Asxl2 and Runx1.

The most widely used material is blood which, next to circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA, is the source of tumor-educated platelets (TEPs). Methods: We developed imPlatelet method which converts RNA-sequenced platelet data to images, additionally implementing biological knowledge from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway. First, we tested imPlatelet method on a cohort of 401 non-small cell lung cancer patients and 62 sarcoma patients. Next, we applied the developed tool to platelets collected from a new, independent cohort of 28 ovarian cancer patients and 30 non-cancer benign gynaecological conditions. Results: imPlatelet provided excellent discrimination between cancer cases and healthy controls, with accuracy equal to 1 in training, validation and independent datasets. When discriminating between ovarian cancer cases and benign conditions, imPlatelet reached 0.91 balanced accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity equal to 0.95 and 0.88, respectively, in an independent test set. ImPlatelet outperformed current state-of-the-art method thromboSeq in the aspects of balanced classification accuracy, the computational power needed, user experience, and execution time. Conclusions: According to our knowledge, this is the first study implementing an image-based deep learning approach combined with biological knowledge to classify human samples. Our results on classification of ovarian cancer considerably outperform previously published methods and our own alternative attempts of discrimination. We show that a deep learning image-based classifier accurately identifies cancer, despite the limited number of samples and even among non-cancer conditions which affect platelet transcriptome making the diagnosis difficult.

H3T3ph creates a docking site for the Chromosomal Passenger Complex at the inner centromere, enabling correction of erratic microtubule-chromosome contacts and preventing chromosome mis-segregation. Surprisingly, Haspin knockout in the mouse does not cause developmental defects, except for testicular anomalies. Therefore, the physiological role of this kinase and the mechanistic significance of H3T3ph are in question. We show here that mouse embryonic stem cells that lack or overexpress Haspin are prone to chromosome misalignment. However, the cell population as a whole maintains the ability to expand and differentiate into multiple lineages. Although not essential for pluripotency, Haspin affects the expression of several testis-specific genes. Furthermore, the H3T3ph mark is detected in under-condensed chromatin domains of haploid spermatids, in cis with lysine/arginine methylation marks. We propose that Haspin controls a compound phospho-methyl switch and regulates testis-specific transcription.		E14 stem cells;12910la;E3.5;Haspin Overexpression;Haspin knock out;WT

In Parkinson’s disease (PD), dopaminergic neurons are a vulnerable population progressively lost during the course of the disease, but the effects of PD on astrocytes and astrocyte-to-neuron communication remains mostly unknown. This study focuses on the effects of the PD-related mutation LRRK2 G2019S in astrocytes, using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. We report the alteration of extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis in astrocytes, and we identify the abnormal accumulation of key PD-related proteins within multi vesicular bodies (MVBs). We found that dopaminergic neurons internalize astrocyte-secreted EVs but LRRK2 G2019S EVs are abnormally enriched in the neurites and provide only marginal neurotrophic support to dopaminergic neurons. Thus, dysfunctional astrocyte-to-neuron communication via altered EV biological properties could participate in the progression of PD.

GSE148933	2021.10.06	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Glycogen phase separation drives liver tumor initiation	Glycogen is the largest soluble cytosolic macromolecule and considered as the principal storage form of glucose. Cancer cells generally increase their glucose consumption and rewire their metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis to promote growth. Here we report that glycogen accumulation is a key initiating oncogenic event and essential for malignant transformation. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that G6PC, an enzyme catalyzing the last step of glycogenolysis, is frequently downregulated to augment glucose storage in pro-tumor cells. Accumulated glycogen undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, which results in the assembly of the laforin-Mst1/2 complex and consequently traps Hippo kinases Mst1/2 in glycogen liquid droplets to relieve their inhibition on Yap. Moreover, G6PC or another glycogenolysis enzyme PYGL deficiency in both human and mice result in glycogen storage disease with enlarged liver size and cancer development, phenocopying Hippo deficiency. Consistently, elimination of glycogen accumulation abrogates liver enlargement and cancer incidence, whereas increasing glycogen storage accelerates tumorigenesis. Thus, we concluded that glycogen not only provides nutrition and energy to the cells but also functions as a key initiating oncogenic metabolite, which physically blocks Hippo signaling through glycogen phase separation to augment pro-tumor cell initiation and progression.		liver;Small  glycogen stacked region;Normal;C57BL/6;early

A new oral histone deacetylase inhibitor, chidamide shows anti-tumor activity by activating the pro-apoptosis pathway in some other hematological malignancies, suggesting its potential application to the relapsed and refractory B cell lymphoma. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effects of chidamide on the cell and mouse models of the rituximab/chemotherapy resistant B cell lymphoma, as well as the primary B cell lymphoma cells. In Raji-4RH and RL-4RH cells, the rituximab/chemotherapy resistant B cell lymphoma cell lines (RRCL), chidamide treatment induced growth inhibition and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, which were associated with E2F1/2 inactivation and CDK2 degradation. The primary B cell lymphoma cells from Rituximab/chemotherapy relapsed and refractory patients were also very sensitive to chidamide treatment. Interestingly, chidamide triggered the cell death via the autophagy pathway instead of the activation of apoptosis in Raji-4RH and RL-4RH cells, likely due to the lack of the pro-apoptotic proteins in these resistant cells. In the RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, we identified BTG1 and FOXO1 as the direct target genes of chidamide, which control the autophagy and cell cycle respectively in RRCL treated with chidamide. Moreover, the combination of chidamide with the chemotherapy drug Cisplatin sensitized the RRCL to growth inhibition in a synergistic manner. Chidamide-Cisplatin combination significantly reduced the tumor burden of a mouse lymphoma model established with engraftment of RRCL. Taken together, our studies provides a theoretic and mechanistic basis for further evaluation of the chidamide-based clinical trial for rituximab/chemotherapy relapsed and refractory B cell lymphoma patients.

Using de novo analysis, we predicted motif enrichment of master transcription factor in super-enhancers. We show that transcription factor-binding sites of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) family are enriched at super-enhancers identified in cell lines derived from liver metastases, but not those derived from primary tumors. Using ChIP-Seq of acetylated H3K27, the enrichment of HNF1 binding motifs in super enhancers was found in a cell line derived from xenografted liver metastasis but not the parental cell line. The prediction method was further extended to pancreatic cancer where liver metastasis is also a common finding, and a similar enrichment of HNF1 family motif in super-enhancers was found. We subsequently showed that HNF1A was prominently expressed and significantly upregulated in metastatic cell lines and clinical specimens of liver metastases. Collectively, our study implicates HNF1A as a master transcription factor involved in shaping global super-enhancer landscape in CRC liver metastasis.

Upon their release into the circulation, monocytes are recruited to inflammatory sites, where they differentiate into monocyte-derived effector cells. In absence of overt inflammation, monocytes also extravasate into selected tissues, where they complement tissue-resident macrophage compartments. Recent studies have uncovered binary developmental trajectories of monocytes in the BM with Neutrophil-like (NeuMo) and dendritic cell (DC)-like (DCMo) monocytes differentiating downstream of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) and macrophage-dendritic cell progenitors (MDP), respectively (Weinreb et al., 2020; Yanez et al., 2017). Yet, the molecular cues that dictate BM monocyte differentiation remain incompletely understood. The COMMD (copper metabolism MURR1 domain) family includes 10 evolutionarily conserved proteins. Functions of COMMD proteins are still being defined, but they seem to play non-redundant roles in regulating transcription and protein trafficking. Utilizing conditional COMMD10 knockout mice we uncovered a role for COMMD10 in limiting inflammasome activation in Ly6Chi monocytes during experimental sepsis and colitis (Mouhadeb et al., 2018), and in supporting phagolysosomal biogenesis and maturation in KCs and BM-derived macrophages infected with Staphylococcus aureus (Ben Shlomo et al., 2019). Hence, these studies mark COMMD10 as a candidate mediator of monocyte and macrophage fate and immune responses. Here we studied the effect of COMMD10-deficiency on Ly6Chi monocyte differentiation. We show that COMMD10-deficiency in steady state Ly6Chi monocytes promotes a differentiation bias towards NeuMo fate.

Specifically, infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes and their-derived macrophage (MoMFs) descendants prevail in acute or chronic liver injury, display marked transcriptional variance and provide crucial functional plasticity. A specific example of MoMFs are lipid associated macrophages (LAMs) involved in progression of metabolic liver disease (Remmerie et al., 2020). Recent studies have uncovered binary developmental trajectories of monocytes in the BM with Neutrophil-like (NeuMo) and dendritic cell (DC)-like (DCMo) monocytes (Weinreb et al., 2020; Yanez et al., 2017), hence further challenging our current comprehension of macrophage heterogeneity in the diseased liver. Yet, the molecular factors regulating their inflammatory versus restorative activity remains enigmatic. The COMMD (copper metabolism MURR1 domain) family includes 10 evolutionarily conserved proteins. Functions of COMMD proteins are still being defined, but they seem to play non-redundant roles in regulating transcription and protein trafficking. Utilizing conditional COMMD10 knockout mice we uncovered a role for COMMD10 in limiting inflammasome activation in Ly6Chi monocytes during experimental sepsis and colitis (Mouhadeb et al., 2018), and in supporting phagolysosomal biogenesis and maturation in KCs and BM-derived macrophages infected with Staphylococcus aureus (Ben Shlomo et al., 2019). Hence, these studies mark COMMD10 as a candidate mediator of monocyte and macrophage fate and immune responses. Here we studeid the effect of COMMD10-deficiency on Ly6Chi monocyte differentiation and inflammatory behaviour in the injured liver, using an acute model of acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI). Bulk RNAseq analysis of sorted Ly6Chi monocytes, comparing between COMMD10+ and COMMD10-deficient cells, revealed an increased differentiation bias of Ly6Chi monocytes towards NeuMo and LAM differentiation fates. Collectively, COMMD10 appears as an important regulator of Ly6Chi monocyte fate decisions and reparative behavior in the diseased liver.

Instructed by local cues, these cells adopt unique transcriptional modules that impart tissue-specific functional identity (Varol et al., 2015). In the liver, Kupffer cells (KCs) dominate the homeostatic macrophage pool. They reside in the sinusoidal vessels and in the space of Disse, interacting with hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and hepatocytes (Bonnardel et al., 2019), where they act as sentinels and perform specialized accessory functions involving iron and lipid metabolism (Scott and Guilliams, 2018). Yet, the molecular cues governing KC differentiation and maintanence remain largly elusive. Embryonic lethality of COMMD10 deficiency has hampered the study of its function. Yet, utilizing conditional COMMD10 knockout mice we recently uncovered a role for COMMD10 in supporting phagolysosomal biogenesis and maturation in KCs and BM-derived macrophages infected with Staphylococcus aureus (Ben Shlomo et al., 2019). Here we show that COMMD10-deficient KCs adopt liver-specific identity. Strikingly, COMMD10-deficiency in KCs and in other tissue resident macrophages impedes their homeostatic survival, leading to their continuous replacement by Ly6Chi monocytes. Transcriptional analysis of COMMD10-deficiet KCs reveales a notable reduction in genes encoding for translation initiation- and ribosomal complex proteins, for ubiquitin and the proteasome protein complex, and for key proteins of the mitochondrial respiration chain. These transcriptional alterations allude to protein stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and hint at the reason of their premature death.		8 weeks old;liver;Clec4FDCommd10;Commd10fl/fl;Male;KCs sorted from steady state livers;KCs;C57BL/6

Specifically, infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes and their-derived macrophage (MoMFs) descendants prevail in acute or chronic liver injury, display marked transcriptional variance and provide crucial functional plasticity. A specific example of MoMFs are lipid associated macrophages (LAMs) involved in progression of metabolic liver disease (Remmerie et al., 2020). Recent studies have uncovered binary developmental trajectories of monocytes in the BM with Neutrophil-like (NeuMo) and dendritic cell (DC)-like (DCMo) monocytes (Weinreb et al., 2020; Yanez et al., 2017), hence further challenging our current comprehension of macrophage heterogeneity in the diseased liver. Yet, the molecular factors regulating their inflammatory versus restorative activity remains enigmatic.

Upon germinal vesicle breakdown, oocyte meiosis resumes and the synthesis of new transcripts ceases. To quantitatively profile the transcriptomic dynamics after meiotic resumption throughout the oocyte maturation, we generated transcriptome sequencing data with individual mouse oocytes at three main developmental stages: germinal vesicle (GV), metaphase I (MI), and metaphase II (MII). When clustering the sequenced oocytes, results showed that isoform-level expression analysis outperformed gene-level analysis, indicating isoform expression provided extra information that was useful in distinguishing oocyte stages. Comparing transcriptomes of the oocytes at the GV stage and the MII stage, in addition to identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we detected many differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), some of which came from genes that were not identified as DEGs. When breaking down the isoform-level changes into alternative RNA processing events, we found the main source of isoform composition changes was the alternative usage of polyadenylation sites. With detailed analysis focusing on the alternative usage of 3'-UTR isoforms, we identified, out of 3810 tested genes, 512 (13.7%) exhibiting significant switches of 3'-UTR isoforms during the process of moues oocyte maturation. Altogether, our data and analyses suggest the importance of examining isoform abundance changes during oocyte maturation, and further investigation of the pervasive 3'-UTR isoform switches in the transition may deepen our understanding on the molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian early development.

Here, we show that EMT transcription factors promote ciliogenesis upon intermediate EMT transition states by activating ciliogenesis inducers, including FGFR1. The resulting primary cilia promote BBS11-dependent ubiquitination and inactivation of a central signaling node, GLIS2. We show that GLIS2 inactivation promotes MaSC stemness, and GLIS2 is required for normal mammary gland development. Moreover, GLIS2 inactivation is required to induce the proliferative and tumorigenic capacities of the Mammary-Tumor-initiating cells (MaTICs) of claudin-low breast cancers. Claudin-low breast tumors can be segregated from other breast tumor subtypes based on a GLIS2-dependent gene expression signature. Collectively, our findings establish molecular mechanisms by which EMT programs induce ciliogenesis to control MaSC and MaTIC biology, mammary gland development, and claudin-low breast cancer formation.

By harnessing these disparities through derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from the BXD mouse genetic reference panel, along with C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) parental strains, we demonstrate genetically determined biases in lineage commitment and identify major regulators of the pluripotency epigenome. Upon transition to formative pluripotency using epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), B6 quickly dissolves naïve networks adopting gene expression modules indicative of neuroectoderm lineages; whereas D2 retains aspects of naïve pluripotency with little bias in differentiation. Genetic mapping identifies 6 major trans-acting loci co-regulating chromatin accessibility and gene expression in ESCs and EpiLCs, indicating a common regulatory system impacting cell state transition. These loci distally modulate occupancy of pluripotency factors, including TRIM28, P300, and POU5F1, at hundreds of regulatory elements. One trans-acting locus on Chr 12 primarily impacts chromatin accessibility in ESCs; while in EpiLCs the same locus subsequently influences gene expression, suggesting early chromatin priming. Consequently, the distal gene targets of this locus are enriched for neurogenesis genes and were more highly expressed when cells carried B6 haplotypes at this Chr 12 locus, supporting genetic regulation of biases in cell fate. Spontaneous formation of embryoid bodies validated this with B6 showing a propensity towards neuroectoderm differentiation and D2 towards definitive endoderm, confirming the fundamental importance of genetic variation influencing cell fate decisions.

Innate immune dynamics during COVID-19 ARDS, compared to ARDS from other respiratory pathogens, is unclear. Moreover, mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of dexamethasone during severe COVID-19 remain elusive. Using scRNA-seq and plasma proteomics, we discovered that compared to bacterial ARDS, COVID-19 was associated with expansion of distinct neutrophil states characterized by interferon (IFN) and prostaglandin (PG) signalling. Dexamethasone during severe COVID-19 depleted circulating neutrophils, altered IFNactive neutrophils, downregulated interferon-stimulated gene, and activated IL1R2+ve neutrophils. Dexamethasone also expanded immunosuppressive immature neutrophils and remodeled cellular interactions by changing neutrophils from information receivers into information providers. Male patients had higher proportions of IFNactive neutrophils, preferential steroid-induced immature neutrophil expansion, and possibly different effects on outcome.

A set of genes was identified as common heart failure markers characterized by correlation of their expression with cardiac morphology, systolic function and NT-proBNP.

In contrast, the expression of other genes including the Ca2+ flux regulating genes phospholamban (PLN), sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA), and extracellular matrix proteins showed significant correlation with LVEF and LVEDDI only.

Here, we used a double-hit rat model, combining maternal immune activation (MIA) and peripubertal stress (PUS), to study cocaine addiction and the underlying neurobehavioral alterations. We injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline on gestational days 15 and 16 to pregnant rats. Their male offspring were then subjected to unpredictable stress during adolescence. When rats reached adulthood, we studied their cocaine addiction-like behavior, impulsivity and conditioning processes, and several aspects of brain structure and function by MRI, PET and RNAseq. MIA facilitated the acquisition of cocaine self-administration but PUS reduced cocaine intake, an effect that was reversed by MIA. MIA increased motivation for cocaine and revearsed the effects of PUS during extended access. Incubation of seeking was unaffected. Neither hit alone nor their combination impacted pavlovian or instrumental learning or impulsiveness. At the brain level, PUS reduced hippocampal volume and hyperactivated the dorsal subiculum. When combined, both hits altered the structure and function of the dorsal striatum increasing its volume and interferring with glutamatergic dynamics. MIA alone had no effect on the gene expression of the nucleus accumbens but, when combined with PUS, modulated specific genes that could account for the decreased cocaine intake. PUS had a profund effect on the dorsal striatal transcriptome however, this was obliterated when PUS occurred in animals with MIA. These results describe a complex interplay between MIA and stress on neurodevelopment and in the susceptibility to develop cocaine addiction.

However, its effects and regulatory mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) are still unproved. In this study, the in vitro experiments including CCK8, EdU, Transwell, flow cytometry analyses and in vivo tumorigenesis model were conducted to assess the effects of DHA on the bio-behaviors of CRC cells. Additionally, RNA-seq combined with gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses was used to obtain the targets of DHA and these were verified by molecular docking, qRT-PCR and Western blot. As a result, we found that DHA significantly suppressed the proliferation, DNA synthesis and invasive capabilities, and induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HCT116, DLD1 and RKO cells in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses indicated that the targets of DHA were predominantly enriched in cell cycle-associated pathways, including CDK1, CCNB1 and PLK1, and DHA could bind with CDK1/CCNB1 complex and inhibit the activation of CDK1/CCNB1/PLK1 signaling. Moreover, cucurbitacin E, a specific inhibitor of CDK1/CCNB1 axis enhanced the inhibitory effects of DHA on DNA synthesis and colony formation in HCT116 and DLD1 cells. In short, DHA could suppress the tumorigenesis and cycle progression of CRC cells by targeting CDK1/CCNB1/PLK1 signaling.		20μM DHA;HCT116;HCT116_control;HCT116_DHA;control DMSO;Colorectal cancer cell line

Dissecting super-enhancer (SE) driven transcriptional dependencies of cancer has been shown to facilitate identifying novel oncogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets or strategies. In this study, our integrative SE analyses of primary tissues and patient-derived tumor cell lines of G3-MB revealed their partially conserved SE-associated transcripts were enriched of subtype-specific tumor-dependent genes and MB patients harboring enrichment of those transcripts exhibited worse prognosis. Fourteen such conserved SE-associated genes were identified to be members of SE-driven core transcriptional regulatory network of G3-MB, including three well-recognized master TFs and eleven newly identified effector oncogenes. ARL4D, one of the effector oncogenes, was further demonstrated to exert its oncogenic role via maintaining cell-cycle progression and stemness of G3-MB cells. Moreover, BET inhibition with CDK7 inhibition or proteasome inhibition, two combinatory strategies of targeting SE complex components (BRD4, CDK7) or SE-associated effector oncogene (PSMB5), were shown to exhibit synergistic therapeutic effects against G3-MB. Taken together, our study verifies the oncogenic role and therapeutic potential of SE-driven transcriptional dependencies of G3-MB, resulting in better understanding of its tumor biology and identification of novel SE-associated therapeutic targets or strategies.		0.1% DMSO treated for 24 hours;untreated;UW228;100 nM THZ1 treated for 6 hours;lentivirus infected for four days;MB002;1 μM JQ1 treated for 24 hours;SHH subtype Medulloblastoma cell;HDMB03;D425;0.1% DMSO treated for 6 hours;Group 3 subtype Medulloblastoma cell

Furthermore, it has been reported that salidroside has anti-inflammatory properties, but its role in macrophage function is not yet understood. In this study, we aimed to determine how 15-LOX-2 expression levels affect the function of macrophages and the effect of salidroside on 15-LOX-2-deficient macrophages. We used multiple functional genetic strategies to determine 15-LOX-2 function in macrophages. 15-LOX-2 deficiency promoted phagocytosis and the proliferation of macrophages and impaired their apoptosis. Mechanistically, the expression levels of cyclophilin B (CypB) were upregulated in 15-LOX-2-deficient Ana-1 macrophages, whereas those of caspase-3 were downregulated. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed that inflammation, complement, and TNF-α signaling pathways were all activated in 15-LOX-2-deficient Ana-1 macrophages. Treatment of 15-LOX-2-deficient macrophages with salidroside, a natural product derived from Rhodiola species, effectively reversed the effects of 15-LOX-2 deficiency on caspase-3 and CypB levels, as well as on apoptosis and proliferation. In conclusion, our study shows a newly identified link between 15-LOX-2 deficiency and salidroside in regulating macrophage survival, proliferation, and function. Salidroside may be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating inflammation-related diseases resulting from 15-LOX-2 deficiency.		shRen;sh15-LOX;Ana-1

It has been characterized that heart resident and infiltrated macrophages play important roles in the cardiac remodeling in response to cardiac pressure overload, however, role of T cells has not been well characterized. Here we show that CD8+T cell depletion resulted in the late stage heart protection, but induced cardioprotective hypertrophy at an early stage of heart failure caused by cardiac pressure overload. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that cardioprotective hypertrophy was characterized by an expression of mitochondrial genes and growth factor receptors genes. CD8+T cells regulated the conversion of cardiac-resident macrophages as well as infiltrated macrophages to cardioprotective macrophages which express growth factor genes including Areg, Osm and Csf1 at the early phase of cardiac pressure overload, which are essential for the myocardial adaptive response. Our results demonstrate a dynamic interplay between cardiac CD8+T cells and macrophages that is necessary for adaptation to cardiac stress, and they highlight the homeostatic functions of tissue macrophages.

Our understanding of the composition and function of immunomodulatory lipid networks in innate immune cells, however, remains incomplete. Here, we show that phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2 or PLCG2) – mutations in which are associated with autoinflammatory disorders and Alzheimer’s disease – serves as a principal source of diacylglycerol (DAG) pools that are converted into a cascade of bioactive endocannabinoid (eCB) and eicosanoid lipids by DAG lipase (DAGL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGLL) enzymes in innate immune cells. We show that this lipid network is tonically stimulated by disease-relevant human mutations in PLCγ2, as well as Fc receptor activation in primary human and mouse macrophages. Genetic disruption of PLCγ2 in mouse microglia suppressed DAGL/MGLL-mediated eCB-eicosanoid crosstalk and also caused widespread transcriptional and proteomic changes, including the reorganization of immune-relevant lipid pathways reflected in reductions in DAGLB and elevations in PLA2G4A. Despite these changes, Plcg2-/- mice showed generally normal pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to lipopolysaccharide treatment, instead displaying a more restricted deficit in microglial activation that included impairments in prostaglandin production and CD68 expression. Our findings enhance the understanding of PLCγ2 function in innate immune cells, delineating a role in crosstalk with endocannabinoid/eicosanoid pathways and modulation of subsets of cellular responses to inflammatory stimuli.		postnatal day 2-3;Plcg2+/+;Plcg2-/-;Neonatal microglia;microglia;C57BL/6

Cellular senescence leads to tissue dysfunction and contributes to the consequences of aging, but whether age-related pathologies including cancer can be alleviated by targeting senescent cells remains largely unclear. Long term retention of senescent cells in vivo, a process mainly attributed to high expression of BCL2 family proteins, causes chronical tissue damages mainly through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Indeed, senescent cells can be removed by several strategies, thus preventing appearance of chronic symptoms and prolonging healthspan. Strategies involving senolytics, which eliminate senescent cells by pharmacological actions, are recently emerging as a novel and prominent solution to ameliorate diverse age-related pathologies. Achieving the goal using synthetic or natural agents would generate a tremendous impact on the quality of life. We test the potential of procyanidin C1 (PCC1), a B type procyanidin flavonoid derived from plant sources including grape, apple and cocoa, in targeting senescent cells through inducing apoptosis and suppressing the pro-inflammatory phenotype. This study demonstrates the efficacy of PCC1 in restraining the SASP expression and minimizing the influence of senescent stromal cells in tumor microenvironment and provides a strong rationale for its future development in anti-aging industrial pipelines.

We investigated the impact of prenatal dioxide nanoparticle exposure on mRNA expression patterns in the brains of neonatal mice. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were intratracheally administered a dioxide nanoparticle suspension (100 ug/mouse) on gestational day 10.5, and brains were collected from male and female offspring at day 1 postpartum. Total RNA was obtained, and mRNA expression profiles were comprehensively assessed using microarray analysis. The results showed 88 and 89 genes were upregulated (≥ 1.5-fold) accompanied by demethylation of CpG islands, whereas 13 and 33 genes were downregulated (≤ 0.67-fold) accompanied by demethylation of CpG islands in male and female offspring mice, respectively. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that these genes were enriched in gene ontology terms related to the regulation of transcription factors, cell proliferation, and organism development. Additionally, MeSH terms related to stem cells and morphogenesis were enriched.		1d;Pooled whole mouse brain, Male, 1d, Vehicle, Prenatal exposure (GD14);Vehicle, Prenatal exposure;Pooled whole mouse brain, Female, 1d, TiO2-NP, Prenatal exposure (GD14);Pooled whole mouse brain, Female, 1d, Vehicle, Prenatal exposure (GD14);Pooled whole mouse brain, Male, 1d, TiO2-NP, Prenatal exposure (GD14);Whole brain;Male;Female;TiO2-NP, Prenatal exposure;C57BL/6

This study was to test the hypothesis that ablation of the Slc6a4 gene would result in morphological changes correlated with defined gene expression changes in the placenta. We found that Slc6a4 KO placentas had a much increased pTGC to spongiotrophoblast area ratio relative to WT placentas. Slc6a4 KO placentas had significantly elevated expression of genes associated with intestinal functions such as nutrient sensing, uptake, and catabolism, and blood clotting. Integrative correlation analyses revealed that upregulation of many of these genes was correlated with the expansion of the pTGC layer. One other key gene in this module was dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), which catalyzes the conversion of L-5-hydroxytryptophan to 5-HT. Our studies suggest a new paradigm relating to how 5-HT operates in the placenta, namely as a factor regulating metabolic functions and blood clotting through autocrine actions. We further suggest that the pTGC are functional analogs of the enterochromaffin 5-HT-positive cells of the gut, which have roles in controlling similar activities within the intestinal mucosa. Our studies suggest a new paradigm in thinking about how 5-HT acts in the placenta, namely not so much as a classic neurotransmitter but as an endocrine factor regulating metabolic functions and blood clotting through autocrine actions.

It has been documented that accumulation of senescent cells accelerates aging and contributes to age-related diseases. Indeed, senescent cells can be removed by several strategies, thus preventing occurrence of chronic disorders and prolonging lifespan and healthspan. Senolytics, which eliminate senescent cells by pharmacological intervention, have recently emerged as a new line of therapeutic agents to ameliorate diverse age-related pathologies. Achieving the goal using natural or synthetic agents would have a tremendous impact on the quality of life. We report the potential of procyanidin C1 (PCC1), an epicatechin trimer natural product derived from plant sources including grape, apple, and cocoa, in targeting senescent cells via induction of apoptosis. This study demonstrates the efficacy of PCC1 in minimizing the influence of senescent cells in tissue microenvironment and provides a strong rationale for its future use in aging control and geriatric medicine.		bleomycin;Normal human prostate derived primary stromal cells;bleomycin/PCC1;control;PSC27;15-20;Prostate stromal cell

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid signaling molecule enriched in plasma, is known to affect BBB permeability. Previous studies focussed on endothelial S1P receptors 1 and 2, reporting a barrier-protective effect of S1P1 and a barrier-disruptive effect of S1P2. Here we present novel data characterizing the expression, localization and function of the hitherto exclusively immunce cell-associated S1P receptor 4 (S1P4) on primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). We detected a robust expression of S1P4 in homeostatic BMECs and pinpointed its localization to abluminal endothelial membranes by electron microscopy. Basolateral S1P treatment of BMECs led to increased permeability in vitro associated with S1P4 downregulation. Likewise, downregulation of S1P4 was observed in mouse brain microvessels after stroke, a neurological disease associated with BBB impairment. RNA sequencing analysis of BMECs suggested involvement of S1P4 in endothelial homeostasis, apicobasal polarity and barrier function. Using siRNA, pharmacological agonists and antagonists of S1P4 both in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrate a barrier-protective function of S1P4. We therefore suggest S1P4 as a novel target regulating BBB permeability and propose its therapeutic targeting in CNS diseases associated with BBB dysfunction.		500nM S1P4 agonist apical;cortex/midbrain microvessel;500nM S1P4 agonist basal;S1P basal;S1P4 KO/KO;pure primary MBMEC (48h puromycin);vehicle control;S1P apical;mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells;C57B/6J

The Illumina TruSeq technology was used to prepare RNA-Seq libraries, and next-generation sequencing was done via an Illumina HiSeq 2000. RNA sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using STAR v2.5. HTSeq v0.6.1 was used to count the read numbers mapped of each gene, and then Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) was calculated to estimate gene abundance. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 R package (2_1.6.3). The resulting P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg's approach. As detected by RNA-Seq, some differential genes regulated by Cfz were significantly involved in cardiac contraction and extracellular matrix (ECM). Among the top 10 up-regulated genes post Cfz treatment,most of thoese genes was related to the heat shock protein expression( HSPA1B,HSPA6,,HSPH1, BAG3). And among the top 10 down-regulated genes post Cfz treatment, some correlated to contraction and Extra cellular matrix ( ITG11, SLC9A3, TNN1) . Conclusion: Carfilzomib -induced alteration of hiPSC-CM transcriptomic profiles. Enhanced HSPs and down regulate cardiac related contraction gene and extracellular matrix.

To date, attempts to define the characteristics of in vivo resistant blasts have focused on comparisons between leukemic cells at presentation and relapse. However, further treatment responses are often seen following relapse, suggesting that most blasts remain chemosensitive. Here we characterize in vivo chemoresistant blasts by studying the transcriptional and genetic features of blasts from before and after induction chemotherapy using paired samples from 6 patients with primary refractory AML.		primary refractory AML;Post-chemotherapy;Primary AML;CD45low/intCD34+;Pre-chemotherapy;CD45low/intCD117+

Despite this knowledge, there remains limited mechanistic understanding of how paternal exposures modify the sperm sncRNA landscape. Here, we report the acute sensitivity of the sperm sncRNA profile to the reproductive toxicant, acrylamide. Further, we traced the differential accumulation of acrylamide-responsive sncRNAs to coincide with sperm transit of the proximal (caput) segment of the epididymis, wherein acrylamide exposure altered the abundance of several transcription factors implicated in the expression of acrylamide-sensitive sncRNAs. We also identified extracellular vesicles secreted from the caput epithelium in relaying altered sncRNA profiles to maturing spermatozoa, and dysregulated gene expression during early embryonic development following fertilisation by acrylamide-exposed spermatozoa. These data provide mechanistic links to account for how environmental insults can alter the sperm epigenome and compromise the transcriptomic profile of early embryos.		mature cauda spermatozoa;cauda epididymis;acrylamide;acrylamide, epididymal exposure;acryamide, spermatocyte exposure;2-cell embryo;2-cell embryo derived from IVF;sperm;Swiss;control, PBS

GRFT’s preclinical safety, lack of systemic absorption after topical administration, and lack of cross-resistance with existing products prompted its development for topical HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. We evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PC-6500 (0.1% GRFT in a carrageenan (CG) gel) in healthy, HIV-negative, non-pregnant women following once daily vaginal gel administration for 14 days. No significant adverse events, histopathological changes in cervico-vaginal mucosa, or anti-drug (GRFT) antibodies were detected. No cervicovaginal proinflammatory responses and no changes in the ectocervical transcriptome were evident. Vaginal microbiome remained largely unchanged. Reduced abundance of vaginosis-associated bacteria and decreased levels of proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL8 and CCL20) were observed. GRFT was not detected in plasma.

Much remains to be uncovered on how MLL-r AML drives leukemia development while preventing cells from normal myeloid differentiation. Here, we identified that transcription factor MEF2D is a highly expressed gene with a super-enhancer MLL-r AML. Knockout of MEF2D profoundly impaired leukemia growth, induced myeloid differentiation, and delayed oncogenic progression in vivo. Mechanistically, MEF2D loss led to robust activation of a CEBPE-centered myeloid differentiation program in AML cells. Chromatin profiling revealed that MEF2D binds to and suppresses the chromatin accessibility of CEBPE cis-regulatory regions. In human acute leukemia patient samples, MEF2D expression showed a strong negative correlation with the expression of CEBPE. Depletion of CEBPE partially rescued the cell growth defect and myeloid cell differentiation induced by the loss of MEF2D. Lastly, we show that MEF2D is positively regulated by HOXA9, and downregulation of MEF2D is an important mechanism for DOT1L inhibitor-induced anti-leukemia effects in MLL-r AML. Collectively, our findings suggest that MEF2D plays a critical role in human MLL-r AML and uncover the MEF2D-CEBPE axis as a crucial transcriptional mechanism regulating leukemia cell self-renewal and differentiation block in MLL-r AML.		replicate 2;replicate 1;acute myeloid leukemia;Cas9-expressing MOLM-13;sgMEF2D e2.1 infection;sgLuc infection;sgMEF2D e5.1 infection

Recent literature challenged the long-standing notion that neonatal diabetes occurs due to ER stress-induced β-cell apoptosis. Importantly, mechanisms of β-cell failure during the disease progression and why the other wild-type (WT) INS allele is unable to function still remain unclear. Here, our computational modelling studies, short-term and long-term expression studies in β-cells revealed the presence of ER stress, organelle changes and insulin processing defects, resulting in decreased insulin secretion but not insulin secretory capacity. By nine weeks of expression of mutant INS, dominant negative effects of mutant INS were evident and β-cell insulin secretory capacity declined. INS+/C109Y patient-derived β-like cells and single cell RNA-Sequencing analyses then revealed compensatory upregulation in genes involved in insulin secretion, processing and inflammatory response. Our results provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of β-cell failure during INS mutation-mediated diabetes disease progression. Decreasing CHOP-10, sXBP1 or inflammatory response could be avenues to restore the function of the remaining WT INS allele.		hiPSC-derived beta-like cells;INS+/C109Y mutation;wild type;hiPSC-derived β-like cells

In principle, balanced reactivation of such factors could enable further wiring in adults, but their relative contributions may be circuit dependent and are largely unknown. Here, we investigated hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting to gain insight into wiring mechanisms in mature circuits. We found that sole ectopic expression of Id2 in granule cells is capable of driving mossy fiber sprouting in healthy adult mouse and rat. Mice with the new mossy fiber circuit solved spatial problems equally well as controls but appeared to rely on local rather than global spatial cues. Our results demonstrate reprogrammed connectivity in mature neurons by one defined factor and an assembly of a new synaptic circuit in adult brain.

At present, the eRNA function remains enigmatic. Here, we report a 5’ capped antisense eRNA PEARL (Pcdh eRNA associated with R-loop formation) that is transcribed from the protocadherin (Pcdh) alpha HS5-1 enhancer region. Through loss- and gain-of-function experiments with CRISPR/Cas9 DNA-fragment editing, CRISPRi, and CRISPRa as well as locked nucleic acid strategies, in conjunction with ChIRP, MeDIP, DRIP, QHR-4C, and HiChIP experiments, we find that PEARL regulates Pcdh alpha gene expression by forming local RNA-DNA duplexes (R-loops) in situ within the HS5-1 enhancer region to promote long-distance chromatin interactions between distal enhancer and target promoter. In particular, increased levels of eRNA PEARL via perturbing transcription elongation factor SPT6 leads to strengthened local three-dimensional chromatin organization within the Pcdh superTAD. These findings have important implications regarding molecular mechanisms by which the HS5-1 enhancer regulates stochastic Pcdh alpha promoter choice in single cells in the brain.		inhibit eRNA transcription initiation;Pol2;CRISPRi of elogation 1158 bp;control for eRNA overexpression rescue eRNA TSS;control for CRISPRi of elongation;C57/B6;control for CRISPRa;RNase H1 overexpression;DpnII;control for SPT6 knockdown;cortex tissue;control for CRISPRi;Mouse tissue;lentivirus infection stable cell line;control for deletion TSS by CRISPR;control for CRISPRi of elogation;HEC-1-B_2E8 _RNA-seq;CRISPR edittiing sinle-clone cell line;HEC-1-B_A2_RNA-seq;polyadenylation sequence insertion;H3K4me3;eRNA TSS deletion;eRNA overexpression;HEC-1-B_on_NC_RNA-seq;tumor stage;deletion TSS by CRISPR;eRNA overexpression rescue eRNA TSS;wild type;HEC-1-B_14G1_RNA-seq;insert pAS;eRNA transcription activation CRISPRa;wide-type;human endometrial adenocarcinoma;CRISPRi of elogation 1959 bp;inhibit eRNA transcription elongation;del TSS;control for RNase H1 overexpression;control for CRISPRi of initiation;CRISPRi of initiation;SPT6 knockdown;RNase H1 D210N stable cell line;eRNA knockdown;WT;CRISPRi of elongation 1158 bp;control for eRNA overexpression;eRNA polyadenylation sequence insertion;insert Pas;H3K27ac;HEC-1-B_on_3g_RNA-seq;newborn;eRNA transcription activation;interfere with transcription termination;control for HiChIP;CRISPRi of elongation 1959 bp;CRISPRi_e;del eRNA TSS;HEC-1-B cells;control for eRNA knockdown;CRISPRi_i;HEC-1-B;wild-type;HEC-1-B_5E6 _RNA-seq

The enormous cellular complexity of the mammalian brain, however, is a major obstacle for gene expression profiling. Physiologically relevant changes of transcription that occur in specific cell populations are likely to remain undetected in cellularly complex samples. The purification of single populations of neural cell types eliminates these difficulties. We have approached this problem in transgenic mice by labelling genetically-defined neural cell types that express variants of GFP. When combined with isolation techniques such as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) or laser capture microdissection (LCM), the isolation of intact RNA from unfixed cells for global transcriptome analysis is possible. In this study we applied FACS and LCM to isolate neurons and glia to gain insight into cell type specific gene expression. We profiled glial precursor cells, microglia and oligodendrocytes using FACS and generated a transcriptome database for glial cell types. LCM was used to study single isolated callosal projection neurons from the cortex of mouse models, which develop adult onset axonal degeneration a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases such as parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The identification of molecular mechanisms underlying axonal degeneration is critical to design rational therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore we profiled wild type controls, Cnp1 and Plp1 null mutant mice (myelin specific genes) at 4 different time points during adulthood. Cnp1 and Plp1 null mutants show axonal swellings and with age severe neurodegeneration, although CNS myelin seems ultra structural not affected. In summary, we have shown the feasibility to snapshot gene expression profiles of genetically defined neuronal subtypes in vivo and to compare morphologically similar neurons at a given time in pathological conditions. We followed gene expression changes starting from early disease states until stages of severe pathological signs, focusing on cells known to be susceptible to a genetic predisposition. Our analysis revealed several known and novel candidate genes and mechanisms that likely play a role in the early adaptive responses of cortical projection neurons to cope with axonal stress.

This disease is three times more common in women, yet more severe in men, but the mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain largely unknown. MS is initiated by autoreactive T helper cells, but CNS-resident and CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells are the key proximal effector cells regulating disease pathology. We have previously shown that genetic ablation of p38α MAP kinase broadly in the myeloid lineage is protective in the autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), but only in females, and not males. To precisely define the mechanisms responsible, we used multiple genetic approaches and bone marrow chimeras to ablate p38α in microglial cells, peripheral myeloid cells, or both. Deletion of p38α in both cell types recapitulated the previous sex difference, with reduced EAE severity in females. Unexpectedly, deletion of p38α in the periphery was protective in both sexes. In contrast, deletion of p38α in microglia exacerbated EAE in males only, revealing opposing roles of p38α in microglia vs. periphery. Bulk transcriptional profiling revealed that p38α regulated the expression of distinct gene modules in male vs. female microglia. Single-cell transcriptional analysis of WT and p38α-deficient microglia isolated from the inflamed CNS revealed a diversity of complex microglial states, connected by distinct convergent transcriptional trajectories. Microglial p38α deficiency in males resulted in enhanced transition from homeostatic to disease-associated microglial states, with the downregulation of regulatory genes such as Atf3, Rgs1, Socs3, and Btg2, and increased expression of inflammatory genes such as Cd74, Trem2, and MHC class I and II genes. The effect of p38α deficiency was divergent in female microglia, with an upregulation of a small subset of inflammatory genes that overlapped with males, but mostly a unique transcriptional profile that also included an upregulation of potentially tissue reparative genes. Taken together, these results reveal the presence of a p38α-dependent sex-specific molecular pathway in microglia that is protective in CNS autoimmunity in males, suggesting that autoimmunity in males and females is driven by distinct cellular and molecular pathways, thus informing the design of novel future sex-specific therapeutic approaches.		p38alphaf/f Cre-;Wildtype;Conditional Knock Out;Male;EAE induced with 2XMOG/CFA;p38alphaCKOCx3cr1-ER;Microglia

GSE185012	2021.10.01	Homo sapiens	GPL16686	TRUE	TRUE	9	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Expression data from cancer stem cells derived from colorectal organoids	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity. The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory may explain the mechanisms underlying the non-genetic heterogeneity and their characteristics of prominent plasticity are emerging to be elucidated. By tracking the spheroid formation and growth capacity of CRC CSCs with a single-cell resolution using an organoid culture, we revealed CSCs consisted of subpopulations with a dual (fast and slow)-growing pattern. When isolated, the slow-growing CSCs remained slow-growing and converted into dual-growing CSCs under certain conditions. The slow-growing cells showed low levels of MAP kinase activity and were resistant to a MEK1/2 inhibitor as well as chemo-drugs. The MSI1 gene was down-regulated in the slow-growing CSCs and played a key role in the transition between slow- and dual-growing CSCs. Isolation of slow-growing CSCs will provide a platform to elucidate the role of the plasticity of CSCs in drug resistance and tumor recurrence. To disclose the molecular characteristics of the CSC subclones with the distinct growth features, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes between the subgroups.

Here we designed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach to monitor the delivery of a CD19-CAR gene via lentiviral vectors (LVs), i.e. the conventional VSV-LV and the CD8-targeted CD8-LV. LV exposed human donor PBMC were evaluated for a panel of 400 immune-response related genes including LV-specific probes. The resulting data revealed a trimodal expression for the CAR and CD8A demanding for a careful distribution-based identification of CAR T cells and CD8+ lymphocytes in scRNA-seq analysis. The fraction of T cells expressing high CAR levels was in concordance with flow cytometry results. More than 97% of the cells hit by CD8-LV expressed the CD8A gene. Remarkably, the majority of the potential off-target cells were in fact on-target cells resulting in a target cell selectivity of above 99%. Beyond that, the differential gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of restriction factors in CAR-negative cells thus explaining their protection from CAR gene transfer. In summary, we provide a workflow and subsetting approach for scRNA-Seq enabling reliable distinction between transduced and untransduced cells during CAR T cell generation.

In obesity, the increased size of adipocytes is accompanied by an increase in lactate production in adipose tissue, caused by hypoxia in obese adipocytes. How lactate affects metabolism in adipocyte and insulin sensitivity remains unclear. Here we develop a mouse model of MCT1,coding by Slc16a1, specific deletion in adipose tissues, using the AP2 promoter to drive Cre expression. This MCT1 AKO mice develop more severe insulin resistance in obesity with 16 weeks high fat diet treatment, while few changes happen to lipid metabolism in adipose tissues. We used RNA-seq to analyze the gene expression patterns of eWAT of obese MCT1 AKO mice compared to WT, and found significant changes in innate immune signaling and adipocyte apoptosis that reflect systemic inflammation and insulin resistance.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms that incite changes in immune tone in many nonlymphoid tissues remain largely unknown. We find that time-limited neonatal inflammation induced by transient reduction of neonatal regulatory T cells (Tregs) causes a dramatic dysregulation of subcutaneous tissue in murine skin, accompanied by the selective accumulation of Th2 cells within a distinct microanatomic niche. Th2 cells are maintained into adulthood through interactions with a fibroblast population in skin fascia that we refer to as Th2-interacting fascial fibroblasts (TIFFs), which expand in response to Th2 cytokines to form subcutaneous fibrous bands. Activation of the Th2-TIFF niche by neonatal inflammation primes skin for altered reparative responses to wounding. We further identify fibroblasts in healthy human skin expressing the TIFF transcriptional signature and find these cells at high levels in eosinophilic fasciitis, an orphan disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the skin fascia. Taken together, these data define a novel Th2 niche in skin, functionally characterize a disease-associated fibroblast population, and suggest a mechanism of immunologic priming whereby inflammation early in life creates networks between adaptive immune cells and stromal cells, establishing an immunological set-point in tissues that is maintained throughout life.		64 years;F;skin;forehead;back skin;Skin stromal cells, P22 control;22 days;M;C57/BL6;leg;live CD45- CD31- EpCAM- stromal cells;Skin stromal cells, eosinophilic fasciitis patient;Skin stromal cells, Treg-depleted;live CD45- CD31- Ecadherin- CD235a- stromal cells;Skin stromal cells, healthy control;52 years;Healthy;67 years;PBS;cheek;FoxP3-DTR;DT mediated depletion of Treg cells;Eosinophilic fasciitis;NA;66 years;forearm

GSE182635	2021.10.01	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	3	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			WSB1 regulates c-Myc expression through β-Catenin signalling and forms a feedforward circuit.	The dysregulation of transcription factors is widely associated with tumourigenesis. As the most well-defined transcription factor in multiple types of cancer, c-Myc can transform cells by transactivating various downstream genes. Given that there is no effective way to directly inhibit c-Myc, c-Myc targeting strategies hold great potential for cancer therapy. In this study, we found that WSB1, which has a highly positive correlation with c-Myc in 10 cancer cell lines and clinical samples, is a direct target gene of c-Myc, and can positively regulate c-Myc expression, which forms a feedforward circuit promoting cancer development. RNA sequencing results from Bel-7402 cells confirmed that WSB1 promoted c-Myc expression through the β-Catenin pathway. Mechanistically, WSB1 affected β-Catenin destruction complex-PPP2CA assembly and E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor β-TRCP recruitment, which inhibited the ubiquitination of β-Catenin and transactivated c-Myc. Of interest, the effect of WSB1 on c-Myc was independent of its E3 ligase activity. Moreover, overexpressing WSB1 in the Bel-7402 xenograft model could further strengthen the tumour-driven effect of c-Myc overexpression. Thus, our findings revealed a novel mechanism involved in tumourigenesis in which the WSB1/c-Myc feedforward circuit played an essential role, highlighting a potential c-Myc intervention strategy in cancer treatment.

Previous work has demonstrated that a subset of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells expresses TCF-1, and that this population sustains the T cell response over time. However, the mechanisms that contribute to the generation and maintenance of TCF-1+ CD8+ T cells remain poorly understood. Here, using a model of lung adenocarcinoma, we demonstrate that TCF-1+ CD8+ T cells are found within both tumor and tumor draining LN (dLN), but phenotypically and functionally differ based on location. In tumors, TCF-1+ CD8+ T cells become dysfunctional with time, are heterogeneous, and decline over the course of progression, while TCF-1+ CD8+ T cells in the dLN remain stable. Blocking egress from the dLN decreased SlamF6+ TCF-1+ CD8+ T cells in tumors, demonstrating that the dLN is a critical reservoir of functional CD8+ T cells. Concomitant with the decline in CD8+ T cells in the tumor, migratory conventional dendritic cell type I (cDC1) numbers decreased in the dLN. Therapeutically, boosting cDC1 numbers and function using Flt3L/anti-CD40 antibody resulted in T cell proliferation within the dLN, an increased SlamF6+ TCF-1+ CD8+ T cells in tumors, and a decreased tumor burden. These data demonstrate the importance of migratory cDC1 cells in boosting TCF-1+ CD8+ T cells in the dLN, and provide rationale for targeting DCs in immunotherapy.

PRMT5 inhibition or deletion in CD4 Th cells reduces TcR engagement-induced IL-2 production and Th cell expansion and confers protection against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of Multiple Sclerosis. However, the mechanisms by which PRMT5 modulates T helper (Th) cell proliferation are still not completely understood and neither are the methylation targets in T cells. In this manuscript, we uncover the role of PRMT5 on alternative splicing (AS) in activated T cells and identify several targets of PRMT5 SDM involved in splicing. In addition, we find a possible link between PRMT5 mediated AS of Trpm4 (Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member 4) and TcR/NFAT signaling/IL-2 production. This understanding may guide development of drugs targeting these processes to benefit patients with T cell-mediated diseases.		iCD4-PRMT5fl/fl;iCD4-PRMT5 delta/delta;CD4 T-cells isolated from spleen and lymph nodes;CD4 T-cells;anti-CD3/CD28 treatment for 48hr;C57BL/6

However, a systematic study of the regulatory networks and regulatory transcription factors (TFs) of aging in the kidney and kidney remains lacking. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of multi-omics datasets in the kidney and kidney from young and aged mice, including RNA-seq, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and ATAC-seq datasets, which indicated that enhanced inflammation and dysregulated metabolism were conserved signatures in aged kidney and kidney in both the transcriptome and epigenome. Transcription factor and regulatory network analysis indicated that activation of AP-1 and SPI1 was responsible for enhanced inflammation, and down-regulation of HNFs and PPARs contributed to dysregulated metabolism in aged kidney and kidney. Importantly, we found that the activation of AP-1 was cellular autonomous in aged hepatic and renal cells. However, enhanced SPI1 was caused by elevated infiltration of macrophages. Importantly, inhibition of AP-1 with small molecule combination attenuated inflammation phenotypes of aging in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our analysis revealed common signatures and regulatory TFs of aging in the kidney and kidney, providing novel targets for the development of anti-aging interventions.		liver from old(23-25 month old) mice;untreated;skin fibroblast;liver;DMSO;kidney from young(2.5 month old) mice;Liver from 20-21 month old mice;C57BL/6;3C;kidney;kidney from 20-21 month old mice;kidney from old(23-25 month old) mice;P9 mice skin fibroblasts;liver from young(2.5 month old) mice

These tumors undergo epigenetic reprogramming turning castration-resistant prostate cancer adenocarcinoma (CRPC-Adeno) into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NEPC). Currently, no targeted therapies are available for CRPC-NEPCs. A major hurdle in the development of new therapies and treatment of CRPC-NEPC is the lack of accurate models to test candidate treatments. Such models would ideally capture components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) factors, which likely regulate the phenotypic, genetic, and epigenetic underpinnings of this aggressive subset. The TME is a complex system comprised not only of malignant prostate cells but also stromal and inflammatory cells and a scaffold of extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM proteins are implicated in the survival and progression of cancer and development of chemoresistance, while are equally integral to the development of prostate cancer organoids. Here, using a combination of patient tumor proteomics and RNA sequencing, we define putative ECM cues that may guide the growth of prostate tumors in patients. Using this molecular information, we developed synthetic hydrogels that recapitulate the tumor ECM. Organoids cultured in the synthetic hydrogel niches demonstrate that ECM subtypes regulate the morphology, transcriptome, and epigenetics hallmarks of CRPC-Adeno and CRPC-NEPC. CRPC-NEPC organoid showed a differential response to small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic repressor EZH2 and Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2), the latter being a novel target in CRPC-NEPC when grown in tumor-specific ECM. Finally, in those synthetic ECM niches where drug resistance was observed in CRPC-NEPCs, cellular reprogramming by a synergistic combination of EZH2 inhibitors with DRD2 antagonists inhibited tumor growth. The synthetic platform can provide a more realistic prostate-specific microenvironment and subsequently enable the development of effective targeted therapeutics for prostate cancers.

In a murine model of T2D reflecting both hyperinsulinemia induced by high fat diet (HFD) and insulinopenia induced by treatment with streptozotocin (STZ), we examined bone healing in a tibia cortical bone defect. A delayed bone healing was observed during hyperinsulinemia as newly formed bone was reduced by – 28.4±7.7% and was associated with accumulation of marrow adipocytes at the defect site +124.06±38.71%, and increased density of SCA1+ (+74.99± 29.19%) but not Runx2+osteoprogenitor cells. We also observed increased in reactive oxygen species production (+101.82± 33.05%), senescence gene signature (≈106.66± 34.03%) and LAMIN B1- senescent cell density (+225.18± 43.15%), suggesting accelerated senescence phenotype. During insulinopenia, a more pronounced delayed bone healing was observed with decreased newly formed bone to -34.9± 6.2% which was inversely correlated with glucose levels (R2=0.48, p<0.004) and callus adipose tissue area (R2=0.3711, p<0.01). Finally, to investigate the relevance to human physiology, we observed that sera from obese and T2D patients exerted inhibitory effects on osteoblastic and enhanced adipocyte differentiation of human bone marrow stromal stem cells. Our data demonstrate that T2D exerts negative effects on bone healing through inhibition of osteoblast differentiation of skeletal stem cells and induction of accelerated bone senescence and that the hyperglycaemia per se and not just insulin levels is detrimental for bone healing.		plastic adherent bone marrow stromal progenitor;10 days osteogenic differentiation + serum from lean subjects;10 days osteogenic differentiation + serum from type 2 diabetes subject;BM-MSC;10 days osteogenic differentiation + serum from obese subjects

Previous work has indicated that transcription factors (TFs) play a role in regulating senescence. However, a systematic study of regulatory TFs during replicative senescence (RS) using multi-omics analysis is still lacking. Here, we generated time-resolved RNA-seq, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and ATAC-seq datasets during RS of mouse skin fibroblasts, which demonstrated that an enhanced inflammatory response and reduced proliferative capacity were the main characteristics of RS in both the transcriptome and epigenome. Through integrative analysis and genetic manipulation, we found that transcription factors E2F4, TEAD1 and AP-1 are key regulators of RS. Overexpression of E2f4 improved cellular proliferative capacity, attenuated SA-β-Gal activity and changed RS-associated differentially methylated sites (DMSs). Moreover, knockdown of Tead1 attenuated SA-β-Gal activity and partially altered the RS-associated transcriptome.

There remains a critical need to identify host immune biomarkers predictive of virologic and clinical outcomes in planning future treatment studies of COVID-19. We recently completed a randomized clinical trial of Pegylated PegIinterferon Lambda for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients conducted in the Stanford COVID-19 CTRU. Leveraging longitudinal samples and data from this trial, we define early immunebaseline and infection-induced signatures that predict the duration of viral shedding, resolution of symptoms, and immunologic memory.		2.035;COVID19;day 0;Male;35.955;17.145;139.535;5.50000000000001;day 5;6.99999999999999;8.05000000000001;7.12;122.415;13.52;102.57;93.69;18.645;61.14;1.245;27.415;41.445;208.705;54.065;12.52;14.595;98.665;Asymptomatic;81.155;85.125;48.84;77.445;69.965;50.13;31.14;107.645;Female;198.205;47.32;3.225;27.885;150.725;149.855;Whole blood;13.3;34.835;53.265;83.45;87.05;118.45;164.3;110.28;15.21;100.68;187.885;22.71;95.51;40.655;61.365;49.495;76.075;60.705;263.94;28.5;59.705;80.87;13.09;85.84;90.37;4.595;22.925;5.38;58.45;6.82;63.535;72.66;46.055;77.015;97.63;NA;39.4;31.66;42.955;32.385;45.065;20.945;89.705;26.17;41.19;88.9;53.215;120.46;70.855;90.705;57.845;16.66;Moderate Symptomatic;20.46;18.665;77.85;73.55;48.145;59.275;1.95;165.34;158.845;117.435;70.225;55.975;19.345;58.085;72.6;Severe;220.985

Previous work has uncovered that microglial properties are strongly dependent on environmental signals from the commensal microbiota while its effect on CAMs remained unknown. By combining several microbiota manipulation approaches, genetic mouse models and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we comprehensively characterized CNS myeloid cell composition and function. Under steady-state, the transcriptional profile and numbers of choroid plexus macrophages were found to be tightly steered by complex microbiota. Divergently, perivascular and meningeal macrophages were affected to a lesser extent. An acute perturbation through viral infection evoked an attenuated immune response of all CAMs in germ-free mice. Additionally, we assessed CAMs in a more chronic pathological state in 5xFAD mice as a model for Alzheimer’s disease whereby exclusively perivascular macrophages displayed enhanced amyloid beta uptake in GF 5xFAD mice. Our results provide novel insights for understanding distinct microbiota-CNS macrophage interactions during health and perturbation that could potentially be targeted therapeutically.

In the immune system, a productive immune response requires the expansion of pathogen-responsive cell types, but whether CC also confers unique gene expression programs that inform the subsequent immunological response remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that single macrophages adopt different plasticity states in CC which is a major source of heterogeneity in response to polarizing cytokines. Specifically, macrophage plasticity to interferon gamma (IFNG) is substantially reduced, while interleukin 4 (IL-4) can induce S-G2/M-biased gene expression. Additionally, IL-4 polarization shifts the CC-phase distribution of the population towards G2/M phase, providing a mechanism for reduced IFNG-induced repolarization. Finally, we show that macrophages express tissue remodeling genes in the S-G2/M-phases of CC, that can be also detected in vivo during muscle regeneration. Therefore, CC defines macrophage inflammatory and regenerative responses in a cyclical, CC-phase-dependent manner.

In this study, we discovered that epithelium-derived antimicrobial peptides defensins activate orphan GPCRs Mrgpra2a/b on neutrophils. This signaling axis is required for effective neutrophil-mediated skin immunity and microbiome homeostasis. We generated two mutant mouse lines, Defensin conditional knockout (Def cKO, K14-cre; Def fl/fl) in which the entire Def gene cluster is conditionally deleted from keratinocytes, and Mrgpra2 double knockout (Mrgpra2 dKO). We used high-throughput RNA sequencing to evaluate the whole transcriptomes of WT and mutant animals' skin under naive condition and 24 hours post-S. aureus infection. Disruption of defensin-Mrgpra2 signaling caused reduction of a network of pro-inflammatory and antibacterial gene expression. This study demonstrates the importance of epithelial-neutrophil signaling via the defensin-Mrgpra2 axis in maintaining healthy skin ecology and promoting antibacterial host defense.		8 weeks old;Def cKO;skin;Skin;Mrgpra2 dKO;WT;Naive;C57BL/6;S. aureus infected
GSE175998	2021.10.01	Homo sapiens	GPL20795	TRUE	FALSE	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Critical role of FGF, RA, and WNT signaling for otic lineage specification from human PSCs in a 2D/3D-combined differentiation system	The otic placode, from which the inner ear develops, initially forms as a thickened ectodermal patch adjacent to the dorsolateral hindbrain. Induction of otic placodal cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provides a robust approach to investigation of otic development. However, attempts to recapitulate otic lineage specification from hPSCs by stepwise differentiation methods have had limited success. One possible reason is that the role of signaling pathways in otic cell differentiation is not fully understood. Here, we developed a novel differentiation system involving use of suspension culture (3D floating culture) in combination with signaling factors for generating otic placodal cells via stepwise differentiation of hPSCs. We demonstrate that hPSC-derived pre-placodal cells acquired the potential to differentiate into posterior placodal cells after fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Subsequent activation of WNT signaling following posterior placode specification induced differentiation of SIX1+/PAX8+/SOX2+ otic placodal cells. qPCR analysis showed that WNT activation increased expression of otocyst markers, including PAX8, PAX2, DLX5 and FBXO2. Moreover, induced otic cells exhibited similar gene expression patterns to the ventral and medial portions of the otocyst that give rise to the sensory epithelium of the inner ear. Collectively, our results indicate a critical role for FGF2, RA, and WNT signaling for the in vitro differentiation of the otic cell lineage from hPSCs. Our new culture system paves the way for improved modeling of early human inner ear development and will be of value to studies on the further differentiation of sensory epithelial cells.		pre-placode cells;embryonic stem cells;induced placodal cells;otic placode cells;hESCs
GSE175470	2021.10.01	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Soluble adenylyl cyclase induces type 17 inflammation and is a potential therapeutic target in psoriasis	Cyclic AMP (cAMP) has a key role in psoriasis pathogenesis, as indicated by the therapeutic efficacy of phosphodiesterase inhibitors that prevent the degradation of cAMP. However, whether soluble adenylate cyclase (sAC) (encoded by the ADCY10 gene), which is an important source for cAMP, is involved in Th17 cell-mediated inflammation or could be an alternative therapeutic target in psoriasis is unknown. We have utilized the imiquimod model of murine psoriasiform dermatitis to address this question. Adcy10-/- mice had reduced erythema, scaling and swelling in the skin and Th17 cell numbers in the draining lymph nodes, compared with wild-type mice after induction of psoriasiform dermatitis with imiquimod. During Th17 polarization in vitro, naïve T cells from Adcy10-/- mice were unable to differentiate to Th17 cells and RNA-seq analysis revealed that sAC was also essential for Th17 cell activation. Interestingly, sAC did not impact Th17 lineage-defining transcription factors (such as RORc and cMAF) but rather was required for CREB-dependent gene expression. Finally, topical application of small molecule sAC inhibitors (sACi) reduced imiquimod-induced psoriasiform dermatitis and IL17 gene expression in the skin. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that sAC is a key factor for inducing type 17 inflammation in the skin and sACi could provide an alternative class of topical therapeutics for psoriasis.

T1 samples were collected 5-8 weeks before the retreat, T2 samples were collected on the day of retreat before starting the meditation method, T3 samples were collected immediately after the retreat, and T4 samples were collected three months after the retreat. Methods: The human blood samples were collected into PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes and stored at -80°C freezer. Before RNA extraction the samples were removed from -80°C and incubated overnight at room temperature. The samples were randomized before RNA extraction to eliminate any time point or age or sex or batch effect. Manufacturer’s protocol of manual purification of total RNA from human whole blood was followed (Qiagen, cat #762164). RNA was reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (Lexogen QuantSeq 3′ FWD), and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 instrument (Illumina). Results: We applied a comprehensive systems biology approach starting with whole blood gene expression profiling combined with multi-level bioinformatic analyses to characterize the co-expression, transcriptional, and protein-protein interaction networks to identify meditation-specific core network after an advanced eight-day Inner Engineering retreat program. We found the response to oxidative stress, detoxification, and cell cycle regulation pathways were downregulated after meditation. Strikingly, 220 genes directly associated with immune response, including 68 genes related to interferon (IFN) signaling were upregulated, with no significant expression changes in the inflammatory genes. This robust meditation-specific immune response network is significantly dysregulated in multiple sclerosis and severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: The present proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the immune system can be voluntarily influenced by non-pharmaceutical interventions like yoga and meditation. This suggests that meditation as a behavioral intervention could have important implications for treating various conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation with a dampened immune system profile.

A major BATF heterodimeric partner, JunB, regulates Th17 differentiation, but the role of JunB in other CD4+ effector T subsets is not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that JunB is essential for accumulation of Th1 and Th2 cells, as well as Th17 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In mice immunized with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), papain, or complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), that induce predominantly Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells, respectively, accumulation of antigen-primed, Junb-deficient CD4+ T cells is significantly impaired. Loss of JunB decreases viability of cells activated under Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-polarizing conditions. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveal that JunB directly regulates expression of various genes that are commonly induced in priming of naïve CD4+ T cells, including a pro-apoptotic gene Bcl2l11 (encoding Bim), and genes that are specifically induced in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells. Furthermore, JunB colocalizes with BATF and IRF4 at genomic regions for approximately half of JunB direct target genes. Taken together, JunB, in collaboration with BATF and IRF4, serves a critical function in differentiation of diverse CD4+ T cells by controlling common and lineage-specific gene expression.

Most studies on ARE specificity of this small family were conducted using the prototypical family member, ZFP36 or TTP; however, less is known about the other family member’s specificity. Previous studies of ZFP36L2 target mRNAs identified a high proportion of transcription factors in two different systems, cells from the erythrocyte lineage and oocytes. However, there is minimal overlap between the genes identified in these studies and those identified here using mouse spleens lacking ZFP36L2 (L2-cKO). This observation suggests that ZFP36L2 targeting is occurring in a highly tissue specific manner. Aiming to understand what factors govern this potential tissue specificity, we characterized the differentially expressed genes in our L2-cKO mouse model in the spleen, an organ that expresses L2 at high levels in humans and mice. We performed transcriptome-wide analysis in RNA spleen samples from mice lacking ZFP36L2 (L2-cKO) and normally expressing (WT). Differential gene expression (DEG) of WT vs. L2-cKO spleens revealed 549 up regulated and 603 down regulated genes. Nine genes were validated in qPCR assays.		ovary;F;L2-cKO;Spleen Organoid;WT;M

However, whether it also plays other functions independent of RNA splicing remains elusive. Here, we find that expression levels of PHF5A are significantly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Down-regulation of PHF5A restrains liver cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that fatty-acid biosynthetic enzymes are major downstream targets of PHF5A in HCC. Through metabolomics analysis, we find that inhibition of PHF5A reduces free fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis, further suppressing plasma membrane function. Mechanistically, PHF5A acts as a transcription co-factor of the p300 acetyltransferase for the H3K27 acetylation (Ac) and promotes H3K27Ac-dependent lipogenic genes expression. Our findings demonstrated a surprising splicing-independent role of PHF5A in transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism for HCC progression and provided a new strategy for HCC therapy by blocking the interaction of PHF5A and p300.

CTLs recognize antigenic peptide derived from tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), thus identification of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) expressed in CSCs/CICs is essential. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) ligandome analysis using mass spectrometry enables analysis of naturally expressed antigenic peptides; however, HLA ligandome analysis requires large scale of sample and it is challenging for CSCs/CICs. In this study, we established novel bladder CSC/CIC model from a bladder cancer cell line UM-UC-3 cells using ALDEFLUOR assay. CSCs/CICs were isolated as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) high cells and several ALDHhigh clone cells were established. ALDHhigh clone cells were enriched with CSCs/CICs by sphere formation and tumorigenicity in immune deficient mouse. HLA ligandome analysis and gene expression (CAGE) using ALDHhigh clone cells revealed distinctive antigenic peptide repertoire in bladder CSCs/CICs, and we identified GRIK2 derived antigenic peptide is specifically expressed in CSCs/CICs. GRIK2 peptide-specific CTL clone recognized GRIK2-overexpressed UM-UC-3 cells and ALDHhigh clone cells indicating that GRIK2 peptide can be a novel target for bladder CSCs/CICs-targeting immunotherapy.

GSE161824	2021.10.01	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	64	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Massively parallel phenotyping of variant impact in cancer with Perturb-seq reveals a shift in the spectrum of cell states induced by somatic mutations	Genome sequencing studies have identified millions of somatic variants in cancer, but their phenotypic impact remains challenging to predict. Current experimental approaches to distinguish between functionally impactful and neutral variants require customized phenotypic assays that often report on average effects, and are not easily scaled. Here, we develop a generalizable, high-dimensional, and scalable approach to functionally assess variant impact in single cells by pooled Perturb-seq. Specifically, we assessed the impact of 200 TP53 and KRAS variants in >300,000 single lung cancer cells, and used the profiles to categorize variants into phenotypic subsets to distinguish gain of function, loss of function and dominant negative variants, which we validated by comparison to orthogonal assays. Surprisingly, KRAS variants did not merely fit into discrete functional categories, but rather spanned a continuum of gain-of-function phenotypes driven by quantitative shifts in cell composition at the single cell level. We further discovered novel gain-of-function KRAS variants whose impact could not have been predicted solely by their occurrence in patient samples. Our work provides a scalable, gene-agnostic method for coding variant impact phenotyping, which can be applied in cancer and other diseases driven by somatic or germline coding mutations.

GSE161551	2021.10.01	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	3	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs and coding mRNAs in SNAI1/2 overexpression cell line	The oncogene SNAI2 is known to be a master transcription factor that regulates a broad range of cellular processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, almost all the studies that associates lncRNA with SNAI2 is based on the lncRNA-miRNA-SNAI2 model. In other words, these studies indicate that SNAI2 is located downstream of lncRNAs, and is regulated by lncRNAs through competing endogenous (ceRNA) mechanism. As a transcription factor, there is no doubt that SNAI2 could directly regulate the expression of thousands of genes, including lncRNAs. Surprisingly, none of lncRNA has been reported to be regulated by SNAI2 so far. In this study, we took SNAI2 as a breakthrough point to screen and identify lncRNAs regulated by SNAI2 in GC. Our data showed that overexpression of SNAI2 caused a 1.5-fold change in the expression of about 654 lncRNAs (|Log2FC| >0.5), and a 2-fold change in the expression of about 123 lncRNAs (|Log2FC| >1).

This double-stranded RNA could interact with ILF2/ILF3 complex. To explore the biofunction of the interaction between ELF3-AS1 and ILF2/ILF3 complex, loss-of-function studies regarding ILF2 and ILF3 were performed in SGC7901 cell line. RNA sequencing studies showed that knockdown of ILF3 significantly decreased ELF3-AS1, while knockdown of ILF2 significantly increased ELF3-AS1 and NF90 expression. Our data revealed that ILF2/ILF3 complex interacted with ELF3-AS1/ELF3 double-stranded RNA and regulated their transcripts stability.

To explore the function of lncRNA ELF3-AS1 in gastric cancer, loss-of-function study was performed in SGC7901 and AGS cell lines. RNA sequencing studies showed that the expression of almost all the histone coding genes were significantly increased after knocking down of ELF3-AS1 in SGC7901 and AGS cell lines. Besides, knockdown of ELF3-AS1 had a profound effect on the expression of a large number of genes, such as ELF3, IGFBP3, ITGB4, TJP3, PPL, DDIT4, IL11, THBS1 and INSL4. Our data indicated that ELF3-AS1 played a tumor suppressor role in GC mainly through regulating SNAI2 signaling pathway.

However, the mechanisms underlying this endogenous regeneration remain poorly understood and this capacity diminishes considerably with age. To identify alternate regeneration pathways in the thymus, we performed an unbiased transcriptome analysis of the non-hematopoietic (CD45-) stromal cell compartment of the thymus, which is less sensitive to thymic damage compared to the CD45+ hematopoietic compartment.		untreated;a sublethal dose of total body irradiation (SL-TBI, 550cGy);thymus;at day 4 post-treatment;CD45- thymic stromal cells;Mouse thymus harvested 4 days post SL-TBI;Untreated mouse thymus;C57BL/6J;female;6-8 wo;thymic endothelial cells
GSE160936	2021.10.01	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Diverse human astrocyte and microglial transcriptional responses to Alzheimer’s pathology	To better define roles that microglia and astrocytes play in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we used single-nuclei RNA-sequencing to comprehensively characterize transcriptomes in these glial nuclei isolated post mortem from non-diseased control and neuropathologically-defined AD brains. Genes associated with AD risk were highly represented, especially in microglia. Transcriptome differences significantly correlated with immunohistochemical phospho-Tau (pTau) density included genetic risk genes for both microglia (APOE, BIN1, MS4A6A, PILRA) and astrocytes (APOE, CLU, MEF2C, IQCK). Pathways associated with the top differentially expressed genes in microglia included those related to proteostasis and immune modulation while those for astrocytes also included proteostasis, as well as stress response and metal ion homeostasis. Inferred regulons generated from co-expression networks implicated distinct transcriptional mechanisms associated with pTau for the two cell types. Data-driven sub-clustering revealed additional glial cellular heterogeneity. Our work provides a new resource, highlighting both potential causal mechanisms and protective glial responses in AD.		6.8;0.0306222439980402;6.9;0.0142729705619982;0.821893;0.0520773058673765;3.79009787811674;0.854616;3.65359;0.861503;0.289797;0.040833;0.226991;female;0.370786;EC;0.0390064;AD;0.0628615;1.38531;1.5556365449907;0.513866;2.59748159863739;0.0812839076766035;1.70910728954132;0.0102396067990989;0.3253;0.374616;0.454358;3.4;7.1;5.3;0.247326689459518;0.03678837487354;0.987485;male;7.6;0.0386487;7.7;0.329722;0.357876;7.9;0.780064091752403;post-mortem cortex;0.00466581126793421;1.94794;0.457716;0.5444;0.821825;SSC;0.331774;0.059688;2.58539;1.76432;0.717751;1.88381742738589;0.066141;0.121599340478153;1.52959;Non-disease control;4.1;0.0314380670079943;6.3;8.1;2.7;8.2;4.6;0.176706403629075;6.6;6.7
GSE160301	2021.10.01	Mus musculus	GPL21103	TRUE	FALSE	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Expression analysis of altered neutrophils from septic mice	Neutrophils are critical for effective anti-fungal immune responses. However, in fungal sepsis neutrophils undergo a phenotypical (Ly6G downregulation) and functional alteration (defective ROS production), impairing their anti-fungal capacity. Therefore we wish to characterize the neutrophils in septic mice transcriptionally to describe their role in driving sepsis. We included several control groups. Mice that lack T cells (TCRaKO mice) have increased resistance to the infection and their neutrophils appear unaltered. We identified G-CSF and DNA/histones to be responsible for affecting granulopoiesis, as rG-CSF and Clodronate liposomes combined expand Ly6Glow neutrohils in naive mice.

GSE159924	2021.10.01	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	57	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Increased adipose tissue fibrogenesis, not impaired expandability, is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is proposed that impaired expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), caused in part by an increase in adipose tissue fibrosis, redirects fatty acids to the liver and other organs, leading to ectopic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. We therefore evaluated whether a decrease in SAT expandability, assessed by measuring SAT lipogenesis (triglyceride production), and an increase in SAT fibrogenesis (collagen production) are associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance in people with obesity. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In vivo SAT lipogenesis and fibrogenesis, the expression of SAT genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) formation, and insulin sensitivity were assessed in three groups stratified by adiposity, insulin sensitivity and intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content: 1) healthy lean (Lean-NL; n=12); 2) obese with normal IHTG content and normal glucose tolerance (Ob-NL; n=25); and 3) obese with NAFLD and abnormal glucose metabolism (Ob-NAFLD; n=25). Abdominal SAT total triglyceride synthesis rates were greater in the Ob-NL (65.9±4.6 g/wk) and Ob-NAFLD (71.1±6.7 g/wk) than the Lean-NL group (16.2±2.8 g/wk), without a difference between the obese groups. Abdominal SAT collagen synthesis rate and the composite expression of collagen genes progressively increased from Lean-NL to Ob-NL to Ob-NAFLD and were greater in the Ob-NAFLD than the Ob-NL group (P<0.05). Collagen synthesis rate and the composite expression of collagen genes correlated with factors that regulate collagen production, including circulating insulin and fibrogenic factors in SAT (all P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adipose tissue lipogenesis and expandability are not impaired in people with obesity and NAFLD. However, SAT fibrogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling are greater in people with obesity and NAFLD than in those with obesity and normal IHTG content. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02706262.

GSE159426	2021.10.01	Homo sapiens	GPL21290	TRUE	FALSE	58	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Machine learning-assisted classification of responders and non-responders to bortezomib treatment regimens PAD and VCD using new experimental dataset of 58 multiple myeloma RNA sequencing profiles	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological cancer which arises from abnormal antibody producing white blood plasma cells. MM affected approximately 500 000 people and results in ~100 000 deaths annually, being currently considered treatable but uncurable. There are several MM chemotherapy treatment regimens, among which ten include bortezomib, a proteasome-targeted drug. Patients with MM respond differently on bortezomib, and new prognostic biomarkers are needed to personalize treatments. However, there is a shortage of clinically annotated molecular profiles of MM that could be used to establish novel molecular diagnostics. In this study we report new molecular profiles for 58 MM patients annotated with data on two chemotherapy regimens which include bortezomib, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (PAD) or bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD). MM biosamples were taken prior to first line chemotherapy treatments and subjected to RNA sequencing.

GSE159339	2021.10.01	Homo sapiens	GPL21697	TRUE	FALSE	15	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			In vitro exposure of leukocytes to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) decreases mitochondrial function and alters gene expression profiles.	The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective strategy for preventing HIV acquisition. The cellular consequences of PrEP exposure, however, have not been sufficiently explored to determine potential effects on health in individuals without HIV. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from people without HIV were exposed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or emtricitabine (FTC) overnight. Mitochondrial mass and function were measured by flow cytometry and Agilent XFp analyzer. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were differentiated in 20% autologous serum for 5 days in the presence or absence of TDF or FTC, and surface markers, lipid uptake, and efferocytosis were measured by flow cytometry. MDM gene expression was measured using RNAseq. Serum lipids were measured using mass spectrometry. PBMCs exposed to TDF or FTC had decreased maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and reduced mitochondrial mass. Exposure to PrEP also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from monocyte subsets. Compared to MDMs cultured in medium alone, cells differentiated in the presence of TDF (829 genes) or FTC (888) genes had significant changes in gene expression. Further, PrEP-exposed MDMs had decreased mitochondrial mass, and displayed increased lipid uptake and reduced efferocytosis. Plasma biomarkers and lipid levels were also altered in vivo in individuals receiving a PrEP regimen. Exposure of leukocytes to TDF or FTC resulted in decreased mitochondrial function, and altered functional and transcriptional profiles. These findings may have important implications for the metabolic and immunologic consequences of PrEP in populations at risk for HIV acquisition.

We evaluated the importance of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT) inflammation and both plasma and SAAT-derived exosomes in regulating insulin sensitivity in people with obesity and NAFLD. Methods: Adipose tissue inflammation (macrophage and T cell content and gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines), liver and whole-body insulin sensitivity (assessed by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and glucose tracer infusion), and 24-hour serial plasma cytokine concentrations were evaluated in three groups stratified by adiposity, insulin sensitivity and intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content: 1) metabolically-healthy lean (LEAN; n=14); 2) metabolically-healthy obese with normal IHTG content (OB-NL; n=28); and 3) metabolically-unhealthy obese with NAFLD (OB-NAFLD; n=28). The effect of plasma and SAAT-derived exosomes on insulin action (insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation) in human skeletal muscle myotubes was assessed in a subset of participants. Results: Proinflammatory macrophages, proinflammatory CD4 and CD8 T cell populations, and gene expression of several cytokines in SAAT were greater in the OB-NAFLD than the OB-NL and LEAN groups. However, with the exception of PAI-1, which was greater in the OB-NAFLD than the LEAN and OB-NL groups, 24-hour plasma cytokine concentration areas-under-the-curve (AUC) were not different between groups. The percentage of proinflammatory macrophages and plasma PAI-1 concentration AUC were inversely correlated with both hepatic and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Compared with exosomes from OB-NL participants, plasma and SAAT-derived exosomes obtained from the OB-NAFLD group impaired insulin action in myotubes. Conclusion: These results suggest SAAT-derived exosomes and PAI-1 are involved in the pathogenesis of systemic insulin resistance in people with obesity and NAFLD.

Whole transcriptomic RNA-sequencing was used to identify the key gene involved in the earliest disease divergence of cTnT-DK210 caused DCM and cTnT-DE160 caused HCM.

IFNγ/LPS-polarized M1-type macrophages can have antiangiogenic activity, whereas IL-4-induced M2-type macrophages can be proangiogenic and profibrotic. Therapeutic strategies to inhibit M2-type polarization while promoting M1-type polarization could serve to inhibit pathological angiogenesis and fibrosis. Here, by combining global quantitative time-course proteomics and phosphoproteomics with a small-molecule inhibitor screen we identify signaling events that promote specifically IL-4-induced and not IFNγ/LPS-induced macrophage polarization and found that the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat potently prevent M2-type macrophage polarization without inhibiting M1-type polarization. In contrast, selective B-Raf inhibition promotes M2-type polarization. Trametinib and panobinostat also blocked M2-type macrophage polarization and concomitantly angiogenesis and fibrosis in models of wound healing and neovascular age-related macular degeneration in vivo. Thus, these pharmacologic inhibitors could be utilized therapeutically to selectively block IL4-induced macrophage polarization and reduce pathologic angiogenesis and fibrosis.

CRC can be induced by luminal factors, like dietary components and bile acids. Bile acids are metabolized from cholesterol in the liver, stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine upon meal ingestion to facilitate the absorption of dietary lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins. Bile acids are effectively reabsorbed at the distal ileum and returned to the liver, and only a small portion (~2-5%) enters the colon. Here primary bile acids, like cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are deconjugated by bacteria and secondary bile acids are formed, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and lithocholic acid. DCA is the major component of the colonic bile acid pool and is found to be increased upon a high fat diet. Moreover, high levels of DCA are known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer by inducing cytotoxicity to epithelial cells. In this study the cytotoxicity of Caco-2 cells to stimulation with cholic acid is investigated.		vehicle (control);3 hr;Caco-2 cells, grown on regular cell culture plate, control condition, pool of 3 samples;Caco-2;Caco-2 cells, grown on collagen-coated Transwell insert, control condition, pool of 3 samples;Caco-2 cells, grown on collagen-coated Transwell insert, treated with cholic acid for 3 hrs, pool of 3 samples;regular 6 well plate;Caco-2 cells, grown on regular cell culture plate, treated with cholic acid for 3 hrs, pool of 3 samples;human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma;collagen-coated transwell insert;sodium cholic acid (2mM)

Despite the demonstration of difference in neuroinvasiveness between JEV strains, little is known about host gene response upon infection of virulent and attenuated JEV strains. To understand the pathogenesis mechanism of JEV infection, we performed a comparative genome-wide microarray analysis (Affymetrix, mouse genome 430 2.0 with 45101 probe sets) of genes expressed in the mice brains three days post intracerebrally inoculated with JEV strains of different neurovirulence. We found that the virulent strain of JEV (RP-9) tended to affect the host gene expression more profoundly than the attenuated one (RP-2ms), as 961 vs. 665 and 655 vs. 509 genes were at least two-fold upregulated and downregulated by RP-9 and RP-2ms, respectively. In order to understand the host defense response against JEV, we further analyzed the microarray data with special focus on immune response. The expression levels of selected genes were further verified by quantitative RT-PCR at 1-, 3- and 5-day post JEV infection. The differentially regulated genes reported here likely contribute to the neurovirulent phenotype by modulating the host immunity, viral replication and/or cytotoxicity.

The molecular switches underlying how the UPR selects for stress adaptation over apoptosis remain unknown. Here we discovered that accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins selectively induces N6-adenosine-methyltransferase-14 (METTL14) expression. METTL14 promotes CHOP mRNA decay through its 3’UTR N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) to inhibit its downstream pro-apoptotic target genes expression. UPR induces METTL14 expression through competing the HRD1-ERAD machinery to block METTL14 ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, mice with liver-specific METTL14 deletion are highly susceptible to both acute pharmacological and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency-induced ER proteotoxic stress and liver injury. Further hepatic CHOP deletion protects METTL14 knockout mice from ER stress-induced liver damage. Our study reveals a crosstalk between ER stress and mRNA m6A pathways, the ERm6A pathway, for ER stress adaptation to proteotoxicity.		METTL14Alb;–;METTL14f/f;Liver;Tunicamycin;anti-m6A (NEB E1610S)

Several pluripotency TFs have been linked to XCR through binding to the long non-coding RNA gene Xist, but whether other regulatory elements are involved is unclear. Here, we show that reprogramming to iPSCs induces gradual acquisition of chromatin accessibility at specific sites on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) which is subsequently propagated to other regulatory elements including enhancers and promoters. Regions that are genomically closer to day 0 accessible regions become biallelically accessible earlier, than the more distant ones. For distinct categories of chromatin regions that become biallelically accessible at different times, different sets of transcription factor (TF) motifs are enriched, including the pluripotency TFs KLF4 and cMYC. In addition, regions that become bialleliacally accessible earlier also show increased TF pluripotency binding, supporting the link between pluripotency TFs in XCR. To further explore the relationship between pluripotency TFs and XCR, we construct the active Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) during iPSC reprogramming using scRNA-seq and computational analyses. We reveal gene targets of 311 TFs expressed across reprogramming to iPSCs. Using this single-cell regulatory atlas, we show that X-linked genes are preferentially targeted by several pluripotency TFs. Our results suggest a new model where XCR may be coordinated by direct targeting of regulatory elements on the X chromosome by pluripotency TFs, concomitant with step-wise acquisition of chromatin accessibility. Altogether, our results demonstrate how gradual acquisition of a new GRN during reprogramming of cellular identity is linked with dynamic induction of chromatin accessibility and overcomes stable chromatin silencing on the Xi.		plate2_H06;plate2_G06;plate2_H05;plate2_F06;plate2_G05;plate2_H04;plate2_E06;plate2_F05;plate2_G04;plate2_H03;plate2_A05;plate2_B04;plate2_C03;plate2_D02;plate2_E01;plate2_A04;plate2_B03;plate2_C02;plate2_D01;plate2_A03;plate2_B02;plate2_C01;plate2_A02;plate2_B01;plate2_D06;plate2_E05;plate2_F04;plate2_G03;plate2_H02;plate2_C06;plate2_D05;plate2_E04;plate2_F03;plate2_G02;plate2_H01;plate2_B06;plate2_C05;plate2_D04;plate2_E03;plate2_F02;plate2_G01;plate2_A06;plate2_B05;plate2_C04;plate2_D03;plate2_E02;plate2_F01;iPSCs

Low-grade gliomas (WHO grade II) invariably progress to high-grade gliomas (WHO grade III or IV). Although malignant progression may take many years, the survival rate after transformation to a high-grade glioma is poor, often only 12-15 months. In this data set, we have identified low-grade gliomas that have progressed to high-grade gliomas or high-grade gliomas that have progressed from low-grade gliomas. Some cases are matched pairs (meaning we have both the original low-grade tumor and the subsequent high-grade tumor). The samples deposited have been analyzed with bulk-RNA sequencing. They are also de-identified but are clinically annotated.

GSE184930	2021.09.30	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	11	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Lithium treatment and human hippocampal neurogenesis	Lithium is a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, where it acts as a mood-stabilizing agent. Although its precise mechanism remains unclear, neuroimaging studies have shown that lithium accumulates in the hippocampus and that chronic use amongst bipolar disorder patients is associated with larger hippocampal volumes. Here, we tested the chronic effects of low (0.75 mM) and high (2.25 mM) doses of lithium on human hippocampal progenitor cells and used immunocytochemistry to investigate the effects of lithium on cell parameters implicated in neurogenesis. Corresponding RNA-sequencing and gene-set enrichment analyses were used to evaluate whether genes affected by lithium in our model overlap with those regulating the volume of specific layers of the dentate gyrus. We observed that high-dose lithium treatment in human hippocampal progenitors increased the generation of neuroblasts (P ≤ 0.01), neurons (P ≤ 0.01), and glia (P ≤ 0.001), alongside the expression of genes which regulate the volume of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. This study provides empirical support that adult hippocampal neurogenesis and gliogenesis are mechanisms that could contribute to the effects of lithium on human hippocampal volume.

GSE184906	2021.09.30	Homo sapiens	GPL23126	TRUE	TRUE	12	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction in Tay Sachs disease are restored by mTOR modulation	Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a inherited lysosomal storage disease resulting from mutations in the α-subunits of the lysosomal enzyme, β-hexosaminidase A, and leads to excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. This disease can be presented in infantil, juvenil and adult forms with rapid, progressive neurodegeneration. Although the link between mTOR and autophagy in Taysachs diseases has not been previously examined, it is reasonably to infer that reduced activity of HexA and the consequent intracellular accumulation of undegraded ganglyosides could lead accumulation of lysosomes, other substrates or dysfunctional organelles, similar to other defects detected in other LSD. In the present study, we show that skin fibroblasts derived from PLS patients presented increased p62/SQSTM1 expression levels and autophagosome accumulation suggesting an impaired autophagic flux.

Although cancer-related CDCA8 hyperactivation has been widely observed, its molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that CDCA8 overexpression maintains tumorigenicity and is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Notably, enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) is identified to be responsible for CDCA8 activation in PCa. Genome-wide assays revealed that EZH2-induced H3K27 trimethylation represses let-7b expression and thus protects the let-7b-targeting CDCA8 transcripts. More importantly, EZH2 facilitates the self-activation of E2F1 by recruiting E2F1 to its own promoter region in a methylation-independent manner. The high level of E2F1 further promotes transcription of CDCA8 along with the other CPC subunits. Taken together, our study suggests that EZH2-mediated cell cycle regulation in PCa relies on both its methyltransferase and non-methyltransferase activities.		shCDCA8;PCa cell lines C4-2;shEZH2;shCTRL;C4-2
GSE184656	2021.09.30	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	15	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Sex-biased ZRSR2 mutations in myeloid malignancies impair plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation and apoptosis	Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an aggressive leukemia of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). BPDCN occurs at least three times more frequently in men than women, but the reasons for this sex bias are unknown. Here, studying genomics of primary BPDCN and modeling disease-associated mutations, we link acquired alterations in RNA splicing to abnormal pDC development and inflammatory response through Toll-like receptors. Loss-of-function mutations in ZRSR2, an X chromosome gene encoding a splicing factor, are enriched in BPDCN and nearly all mutations occur in males. ZRSR2 mutation impairs pDC activation and apoptosis after inflammatory stimuli, associated with intron retention and inability to upregulate the transcription factor IRF7. In vivo, BPDCN-associated mutations promote pDC expansion and signatures of decreased activation. These data support a model in which male-biased mutations in hematopoietic progenitors alter pDC function and confer protection from apoptosis, which may impair immunity and predispose to leukemic transformation.		normal;BPDCN;tumor;pDC

Genome-wide in vivo enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation sequence (eCLIP-seq) shows unexpected specificity for eIF3 binding to a pyrimidine rich motif present in subsets of 5’-UTRs and a corresponding change in the translation of these transcripts by ribosome profiling in Eif3c loss-of-function embryos. We further find that while Eif3c loss-of-function embryos do not show a global decrease in protein synthesis, translation of Ptch1 through this pyrimidine rich motif is specifically sensitive to eIF3 amount. Altogether, this work uncovers hidden specificity of housekeeping translation initiation machinery for the translation of key developmental signaling transcripts.

Fibroblast activation is a common stress response that worsens lung, liver, kidney and heart disease, yet its mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Pharmacologic inhibition of the BET family of transcriptional coactivators alleviates cardiac dysfunction and associated fibrosis, providing a tool to mechanistically interrogate maladaptive fibroblast states and modulate their plasticity as a potential therapeutic approach. Here, we leverage dynamic single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic interrogation of heart tissue with and without BET inhibition to reveal a reversible transcriptional switch underlying stress-induced fibroblast activation. Transcriptomes of resident cardiac fibroblasts demonstrated robust and rapid toggling between the quiescent fibroblast and activated myofibroblast state in a manner that directly correlated with BET inhibitor exposure and cardiac function. Correlation of single cell chromatin accessibility with cardiac function revealed a novel set of reversibly accessible DNA elements that correlated with disease severity. Among the most dynamic elements was an enhancer regulating the transcription factor MEOX1, which was specifically expressed in activated myofibroblasts, occupied putative regulatory elements of a broad fibrotic gene program, and was required for TGFβ-induced myofibroblast activation. CRISPR interference of the most dynamic cis-element within the enhancer, marked by nascent transcription, prevented TGFβ-induced activation of Meox1. These findings identify MEOX1 as a central regulator of stress-induced myofibroblast activation associated with cardiac dysfunction. The plasticity and specificity of the BET-dependent regulation of MEOX1 in endogenous tissue fibroblasts provides new trans- and cis- targets for treating fibrotic disease.

GSE183050	2021.09.30	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	28	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			RNAseq of isolated astrocytes and microglia from APPPS1E4fl/fl mice following astroycte APOE removal	The e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease and has been shown to increase amyloid pathology relative to the presence of the e2 and e3 alleles. In the brain, apoE is primarily produced by astrocytes and under pathological conditions also by microglia. The cell-type-specific role of apoE in amyloid pathology, especially after amyloid plaque deposition, has not been fully elucidated. We generated APPPS1-21/Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2/apoE4flox/flox and APPPS1-21/apoE4flox/flox mice. At 3.8-months-of-age, during the phase of rapid plaque growth, we administered tamoxifen to reduce astrocytic APOE4 and assessed mice at 6-months-of-age. One day before tamoxifen treatment, mice were injected with methoxy-X04, a blood-brain-barrier permeant fluorescent marker that labeled the pre-existing fibrillar amyloid plaques. By using this strategy, we were able to characterize pre-existing plaques prior to the loss of astrocytic APOE4 and to also analyze newly-formed amyloid plaques after the loss of astrocytic APOE4. Interestingly, astrocytic APOE4 deletion strongly reduced pre-existing plaques. It also prevented new plaque formation and decreased glial reactivity. Importantly, the removal of astrocytic APOE4 resulted in enhanced microglial and astrocytic phagocytic ability, which may contribute to the reduction of the amyloid pathology.		cortex, hippocampus, thalamus astrocyte;APPPS1::APOE4fl/fl::ALDH1L1-CreERT;cortex, hippocampus, thalamus microglia;APPPS1::APOE4fl/fl;astrocyte;microglia;APOE4fl/fl::ALDH1L1-CreERT;tamoxifen;APOE4fl/fl

Multiple efforts have characterized the key transcription factors (TFs) that determine the various hematopoietic lineages. However, the temporal interactions between individual TFs and their chromatin targets during differentiation and how these interactions dictate lineage commitment remains poorly understood. We performed dense, daily, temporal profiling of chromatin accessibility (DNase I-seq) and gene expression changes (total RNA-seq) along ex vivo human erythropoiesis to comprehensively define developmentally regulated DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and transcripts. We link both distal DHSs to their target gene promoters and individual TFs to their target DHSs, revealing that the regulatory landscape is organized in distinct sequential regulatory modules that regulate lineage restriction and maturation. Finally, direct comparison of transcriptional dynamics (bulk and single-cell) and lineage potential between erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis uncovers differential fate commitment dynamics between the two lineages as they exit the stem and progenitor stage. Collectively, these data provide novel insights into the global regulatory landscape during hematopoiesis.		CD34_RO03183;CD34_RO03280;CD34+;CD34_RO03269;CD34_RO03256

However, dissecting these cell states and their clinical relevance at scale remains challenging. Here, we implemented EcoTyper, a machine learning framework integrating transcriptome deconvolution and single-cell RNA sequencing, to characterize clinically relevant DLBCL cell states and ecosystems. Using this approach, we identified five cell states of malignant B cells that vary in prognostic associations and differentiation status. We also identified striking variation in cell states for 12 other lineages comprising the TME and forming cell-state interactions in stereotyped ecosystems. While cell-of-origin subtypes have distinct TME composition, DLBCL ecosystems capture clinical heterogeneity within existing subtypes and extend beyond cell-of-origin and genotypic classes. These results resolve the DLBCL microenvironment at unprecedented resolution and identify opportunities for therapeutic targeting (https://ecotyper-stanford-edu.stanford.idm.oclc.org/lymphoma).		non-B cells;N/A;DLBCL;ABC;Tonsil;F;FL;GCB;DLBCL007;GCB DLBCL;ABC DLBCL;DLBCL008;FL1;B cells;FL3;M;FL2;DLBCL111;DLBCL002;Follicular lymphoma;Diffuse large B cell lymphoma;tFL;T2

SMART-Seq® Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing – v4 (TaKaRa, Cat 634888) was used for generating amplified double stranded (ds) cDNA from each sample with 2ng of input total RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting ds cDNA was sheared with Covaris LE220 with the setting of DNA fragment size of 200bp peak. The sheared DNA was used for sequencing library preparation by using KAPA HyperPrep Kits (Roche, Cat KK8500). The final libraries were quantified with qubit and bioanalyzer. The sequencing was performed with the single read mode of 51 cycles of read1 and 7 cycles of index read with V4 reagents on Illumina Hiseq2500. Real-time analysis (RTA) 2.2.38 software was used to process the image analysis and base calling. The nf-core RNAseq pipeline v1.3 was used to process the raw sequencing reads (https://nf-co.re). RNA-Seq reads were trimmed to remove sequencing adapters using Trimmomatic3 and polyA tails using FASTP4. The processed reads were mapped back to the mouse genome (mm10) using STAR software (v. 020201)5. The HTSeq software (v.0.6.0)6 was applied to generate the count matrix, with default parameters. Differential expression analysis was conducted by adjusting read counts to normalized expression values using TMM normalization method in R7. Briefly, for each comparison between HSC KO LSKs and HSC wt LSKs and between EC KO LSKs and EC wt LSKs, general linear models were applied to identify DEGs using TMM normalization expression level as depending variable, and genotype as independent variable. Genes with a p-value less than 0.05 and with a fold change (FC) greater than 1.5 or less than 0.7 were considered as significant up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. Pathway analysis was conducted using GSEAPreranked algorithm using GSEA Desktop program in Java8, 9. The former requires a list of up- and down-regulated genes, while the latter a ranked list of whole genes according to their log2 fold change and p-values. 		EC-Spred1 KO CML mice;LSK from global Spred1 KO CML mice;LSK from EC-Spred1 KO CML mice;LSK from HSC-Spred1 KO CML mice;leukemic stem cells (LSK);LSK from HSC-Spred1 wt CML mice;LSK from Spred1 wt CML mice;Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+;C57BL/6;Spred1 wt CML mice;HSC-Spred1 KO CML mice;HSC-Spred1 wt CML mice;global Spred1 KO CML mice

Eukaryotic cells recognize incoming DNA and limit transcription through repressive chromatin modifications. The human silencing hub (HUSH) complex transcriptionally represses long interspersed element-1 retrotransposons (L1s) and retroviruses through histone H3 Lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). How HUSH recognizes and initiates silencing of these invading genetic elements is unknown. Here, we show that HUSH is able to recognize and transcriptionally repress a broad range of long, intronless transgenes. Intron insertion into HUSH-repressed transgenes counteracts repression, even in the absence of intron splicing. HUSH binds transcripts from the target locus, prior to and independent of H3K9me3 deposition, and target transcription is essential for both initiation and propagation of HUSH-mediated H3K9me3. Genomic data reveals how HUSH binds and represses a subset of endogenous intronless genes generated through retrotransposition of cellular mRNAs. Therefore, intronless cDNA, a hallmark of reverse transcription, provides a versatile means to distinguish invading retroelements from host genes and allows HUSH to protect the genome from ‘non-self’ DNA, despite no prior exposure to the invading element. Our findings reveal the existence of a genome surveillance system and explain how it provides immediate protection against newly acquired elements while avoiding inappropriate repression of host genes.		anti-HA;wild type + L1 reporter;HEK293T;TASOR KO;SETDB1 KO pool;H3K9me3;TAF7 mutant;TASOR KO + L1 reporter;none;HeLa;HEK293T cells;HeLa cells;PPHLN HA knock in; SETDB1 KO pool;wild type;PPHLN1 HA knock-in

The phenotype is indistinguishable from congenital cytomegalovirus brain infection and overlaps with typeI interferonopathies like Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, strongly suggesting a role for innate immunity in its pathophysiology. To date, pathophysiological studies have been hindered by the lack of mouse models recapitulating the neuroinflammatory encephalopathy found in patients. In this study, we generated Rnaset2-/- mice using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Strikingly, Rnaset2-/- mice revealed strong upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes and concurrent neuroinflammation, with infiltration of CD8+ effector memory T cells and inflammatory monocytes into the grey and white matter. Homeostatic dysfunctions in glia cells and neurons revealed by single nuclei RNA sequencing provides initial insights into the mechanism of hippocampal-accentuated brain atrophy and cognitive impairment. Thus, Rnaset2 -/- mice provide an important model, to develop therapies for inborn RNaseT2 deficiency, congenital viral brain infection and further type I interferonopathies.

The endosomal system influences how RTK signalling is coded, but the ways in which it transmits these signals to the nucleus to influence gene expression are not yet clear. Here we show that an RTK, MET promotes Rab17- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis of EphA2, another RTK, followed by centripetal transport of EphA2-positive endosomes. EphA2 then mediates physical capture of endosomes on the outer surface of the nucleus; a process involving interaction between the nuclear import machinery and a nuclear localisation sequence in EphA2’s cytodomain. Nuclear capture of EphA2 promotes RhoG-dependent phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein, cofilin to oppose nuclear import of G-actin. The resulting depletion of nuclear G-actin drives transcription of Myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)/serum-response factor (SRF)-target genes to implement cell scattering and the invasive behaviour of cancer cells.		non targeting siRNA;EphA2 siRNA;NCI-H1306;NCI-H1305;NCI-H1304;NCI-H1303;NCI-H1302;NCI-H1301;NCI-H1300;NCI-H1299;NCI-H1310;H1299 cells;20 minutes HGF;NCI-H1309;NCI-H1308;20 minutes vehicle;NCI-H1307

To explore correlates of response patterns to neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment and post-surgical recurrences, we analyzed longitudinal tumor and blood samples in a cohort of 12 patients displaying 33% responsiveness. Pretreatment tumor-based detection of FLT4 mutations and PTEN signature enrichment favors response, and high tumor mutational burden improves recurrence-free survival. In contrast, preexisting and/or acquired mutations (in CDKN2A, YAP1, JAK2) correlate with innate resistance and/or tumor recurrence. Immunologically, tumor response after therapy entails T-cell receptor repertoire diversification in peripheral blood and intratumoral expansion of preexisting T-cell clones. A high ratio of regulatory to Th17 T cells in pretreatment blood predicts innate resistance, low cytolytic T-cell signature in pretreatment tumor, and low T-cell receptor repertoire diversity in pretreatment blood. Our study provides a molecular framework to advance neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy for patients with resectable head-and-neck cancer.		Post-treatment;Pre-treatment;Human OCSCC;Recurrent tumor

This is particularly true in glial cell types, such as microglia, which as minority cell populations in the brain, may be obscured in whole tissue analyses. Microglia have central functions in development, aging, and neurodegeneration and are a current focus of neuroscience research. A long-standing concern for glial biologists using in vivo models is whether cell isolation from CNS tissue could introduce ex vivo artifacts in microglia, which respond quickly to changes in the environment. Mouse microglia were purified by antibody-conjugated magnetic bead, and cytometer- and cartridge-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting approaches to compare and contrast performance. The Cx3cr1-NuTRAP (nuclear tagging and translating ribosome affinity purification) model was used to provide an endogenous fluorescent microglial marker and a microglial-specific translatome profile lacking cell isolation artifacts. All methods performed similarly for microgial purity with main differences being in cell yield and time of isolation. Ex vivo activation signatures occurred principally during the initial tissue dissociation and cell preparation and not the microglial cell sorting. Utilizing transcriptional and translational inhibitors during the cell preparation prevented the activational phenotype. These data demonstrate that a variety of microglial isolation approaches can be used, depending on experimental needs, and that inhibitor cocktails are effective at reducing cell preparation artifacts.

GSE179474	2021.09.30	Homo sapiens	GPL20795	TRUE	FALSE	15	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Operation of the atypical canonical BMP signaling pathway during human odontogenesis	BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling plays essential roles in the regulation of early tooth development. It is well acknowledged that with binding of extracellular BMP ligands to the type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor complexes when triggering of the BMP canonical signaling pathway, receptor activated Smad1/5/8 in cytoplasm bind to Smad4, the central mediator of the canonical BMP signaling pathway, to form transfer complexes for entering the nucleus and regulating target gene expression. However, our recent studies reveal the functional operation of a novel BMP mediated signaling pathway named as the atypical BMP canonical signaling pathway in mouse developing tooth, which is Smad1/5/8 dependent but Smad4 independent. In the current study, we investigated whether this atypical BMP canonical signaling is conserved in human odontogenesis. We showed that pSmad1/5/8 is required for expression of MSX1, a well-defined BMP signaling target gene, in human dental mesenchyme, but the typical BMP canonical signaling is indeed not operating in the early human developing tooth, as assessed by the absence of pSMAD1/5/8-SMAD4 complexes in the dental mesenchyme and expression of MSX1 and translocation of pSMAD1/5/8 induced by BMP4 protein is SMAD4-independent in dental mesenchymal cells. Moreover, RNA-Seq data sets comparing the transcriptome profiles of human dental mesenchymal cells with and without SMAD4 knockdown by siRNA displays unchanged expression profiles of pSMAD1/5/8 downstream target genes, further affirming the functional operation of the atypical canonical BMP signaling pathway in a manner of SMAD1/5/8-dependent but SMAD4-independent in the dental mesenchyme during early odontogenesis.

We have reported that in the conditional knockout (cKO) mice for Rnu11, a minor spliceosome snRNA, minor intron splicing defect in minor intron-containing genes (MIGs) regulating cell cycle resulted in cell cycle defect with a concomitant increase in yH2aX+ cells and P53-mediated apoptosis. Trp53 ablation in the Rnu11 cKO mice did not prevent microcephaly. Although RNAseq analysis of the double knockout (dKO) pallium reflected transcriptomic shift towards the control from the cKO. We found elevated minor intron retention and alternative splicing across minor introns in the dKO. Disruption of these minor intron-containing genes (MIGs) resulted in cell cycle defect that was detected earlier and was more severe in the dKO, but with delayed detection of yH2aX+ DNA damage. Thus, P53 might also play a role in causing DNA damage in the developing pallium. In all, our findings further refine our understanding of the role of the minor spliceosome in cortical development and identify MIGs underpinning microcephaly in minor spliceosome-related disease.

Here, we show an in vitro reconstitution of whole male germ-cell development by pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are induced into PGC-like cells (mPGCLCs), which are expanded for epigenetic reprogramming. In reconstituted testes under an optimized condition, such mPGCLCs differentiate into spermatogonium-like cells with proper developmental transitions, gene expression, and cell-cycle dynamics and are expanded robustly as germline stem cell-like cells (GSCLCs) with an appropriate androgenetic epigenome. Importantly, GSCLCs show vigorous spermatogenesis, not only upon transplantation into testes in vivo but also under an in vitro culture of testis transplants, and the resultant spermatids contribute to fertile offspring. By uniting faithful recapitulations of the three phases of male germ-cell development, our study creates a paradigm for the in vitro male gametogenesis by PSCs.

Essential for brain formation and function, activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is a major autism gene. Here, a novel Tyr mouse carrying p.Tyr718* mutation (homologous to the most common ADNP syndrome p.Tyr719*) was generated using CRISPR-Cas9. Adnp p.Tyr718* inhibited early mouse development and showed sex-dependent gait deficits. Delayed speech acquisition was translated to sex-specific mouse syntax abnormalities. Mechanistically, dendritic spine densities/morphologies were significantly decreased in Tyr mice. All mentioned impediments were ameliorated by daily treatments with the ADNP fragment, drug candidate, NAP. Early onset tauopathy was male-specific (hippocampus and visual cortex) mimicking the human condition, paralleled by impaired visual evoked potentials and corrected by acute NAP treatment. RNA-sequencing of spleens revealed a comprehensive effect only on females, with 5 transcripts (SMOX, ARRB1, ADCY6, FOXO3, CPXM1), shared as deregulated by different human patient-derived ADNP mutated lymphoblastoid cell lines. With FOXO3 implicated in apoptosis and steroid synthesis, these changes, converging on AKT1, were further translated to sex-specific microbiota signatures. The Tyr mouse is thus a valid model for the ADNP syndrome, with a human-like pathology. NAP’s corrective effects attest to specificity, leading to future drug development with objective biomarkers, including rapidly responsive visual evoked potentials, blood proteomics and microbiota signatures.		saline;spleen;HTR;female;NAP;WT;male
GSE166599	2021.09.30	Rattus norvegicus	GPL18404	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			The changes of the nuclear landscape upon stimulation of neuronal cells are dependent on the histone deacetylase HDAC1	Spatial chromatin organization is crucial for transcriptional regulation and might therefore be particularly dynamic in neurons since these terminally differentiated cells dramatically change their transcriptome in response to external stimuli. Here, we show that stimulation of neurons causes condensation of large chromatin domains. We find that this phenomenon is not only induced in rat hippocampal neurons cultured in vitro, but is also present in vivo in amygdala neurons of rats subjected to fear conditioning, and hippocampal neurons of animals subjected to kainate evoked seizures or High-Frequency Stimulation (HFS). The activity-induced chromatin condensation is an active, very rapid, and reversible process, that is independent of transcription and precedes the expression of Immediate Early Genes (IEG). It is accompanied by the redistribution of posttranslational modifications of histones, and rearrangements in the spatial organization of chromosome territories. Moreover, it leads to the reorganization of nuclear speckles and active domains located in their proximity. Finally, we find that neurons depleted of the histone deacetylase HDAC1 fail to condense chromatin upon stimulation, a phenomenon that can be fully reversed by the introduction of human HDAC1. Taken together, our results suggest that the HDAC1-dependent chromatin reorganization might constitute an important level of fine-tuning of transcriptional regulation in stimulated neurons.		control rat hippocampal culture 3(DMSO solvant treated);rat hippocampal culture 1 with induced cLTP;induced cLTP;hippocampal;control rat hippocampal culture 1 (DMSO solvant treated);DMSO;rat hippocampal culture 3 with induced cLTP;control rat hippocampal culture2 (DMSO solvant treated);rat hippocampal culture 2 with induced cLTP

The relationship between DNA methylation aberrations in normal breast tissue and breast cancer risk remains unclear. Disease-free breast tissue cores donated by high-risk (Tyrer-Cuzick lifetime risk ≥20%) and 78 average-risk women were obtained from the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank and processed for whole methylome and whole transcriptome profiling. We identified 1355 CpGs that were differentially methylated between high- and average-risk breast tissues (ΔZ>0.5, FDR<0.05). Hypomethylated CpGs were overrepresented in high-risk tissue and were found predominantly (68%) in non-coding regions. Hypermethylated CpG sites were found equally in the gene body and non-coding regions. Transcriptomic analysis identified 67 differentially expressed genes (fold change≥2, FDR<0.05, 17 down 50 up), involved in chemokines signaling, metabolism and estrogen biosynthesis. Methylation-expression correlations revealed 6 epigenetically regulated genes in high-risk breast. This is the first gene expression/DNA methylation analysis of normal breasts from women at either high or average risk of breast cancer. Our discovery of epigenetically regulated genes associated with breast cancer risk using a unique resource of normal breast samples opens the doors to a deeper understanding of the process of cancer initiation and provides an opportunity to mechanistically dissect breast cancer susceptibility and risk-associated molecular alterations.		37.60%;35%;11%;10.60%;29.60%;22.5;14.50%;38.40%;45.7;22.3;8.90%;22.2;22.1;8.10%;22.9;22.8;22.7;22.6;13.70%;24%;12%;18.7;51.30%;33.5;33.4;33.3;33.2;18.4;28.90%;33.9;33.8;11.40%;33.7;37%;40.20%;13%;29.9;8.00%;29.8;29.50%;9.60%;21.6;27.30%;21.4;44.8;22.40%;61.70%;21.2;21.1;29.5;29.4;29.3;8.80%;21.9;13.60%;26.60%;Average;12.30%;32.6;32.4;32.2;17.7;11.50%;32.9;24.10%;32.8;32.7;15%;Pre;28.8;AMINALNA;10.40%;29.80%;9.50%;20.7;20.6;20.5;12.80%;31.50%;20.1;43.1;30.70%;13.10%;28.3;16%;39.8;27.90%;12.00%;7.90%;60.20%;25.40%;31.6;31.4;33.10%;7.10%;46.50%;39.4;39.7;28.70%;11.20%;31.9;15.50%;N/A;Yes;27.9;9.40%;55.90%;22.20%;12.90%;27.10%;31.60%;13.00%;27.8;42.1;27.6;27.4;27.3;30.80%;39.00%;42.6;27.1;13.80%;WHITE;Post;12.10%;14.60%;30.8;30.7;30.6;33.20%;30.5;59.20%;30.3;38.7;30.2;11.30%;30.9;59.50%;9%;AFRNAMER;Asian;10.20%;22.10%;30.10%;38.80%;26.9;35.60%;26.7;26.6;13.30%;26.4;8.50%;26.2;41.8;51.70%;7.70%;12.60%;33.30%;37.4;11.80%;58.70%;62.90%;9.20%;10.30%;62.10%;25.2;48.4;40.3;25.8;13.20%;40.7;21.20%;22.90%;27.80%;12.70%;5.20%;25.30%;33.40%;36.1;Breast;50.00%;51.2;51.3;36.9;2.30%;36.6;11.10%;51.7;ASIAN;9.90%;32.70%;28.20%;24.3;38.60%;31.90%;25.90%;24.2;24.1;14.30%;8.30%;4.00%;31.10%;24.8;24.7;24.6;24.5;13.50%;27.50%;12.40%;35.3;35.1;NA;11.60%;35.9;35.7;35.5;35.4;10.10%;15.00%;Don‚Äôt know;45.30%;10.90%;23.4;23.3;23.2;14.20%;23.1;31.20%;30.40%;8.20%;13.40%;23.7;23.6;23.5;High;No;39.40%;42.10%;19.9;19.8;34.40%;19.6;27.60%;12.50%;11.5;46.20%;34.2;19.5;19.4;34.9;34.8;28.40%;34.7;57.2

Here we identified BAF45D is required for expression of phosphorylated SMAD3 and PAX6 induced by RA. Genome-wide analysis revealed that during RA-induced early neural differentiation, BAF45D knockdown failed to activate TGF-beta/SMAD signaling and induce expression of Stat3 and Smad7, two negative regulators of TGF-beta/SMAD signaling. Moreover, BAF45D was immunoprecipited with BRG1and phosphorylated SMAD3. In addition, Smad3 siRNA abolished RA-indueced expression of phosphorylated SMAD3, PAX6, STAT3 and SMAD7. Finally, overexpression of BAF45D directly induced expression of PAX6 and phosphorylated SMAD3.These results suggest that a novel effect of BAF45D cooperating with TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway on PAX6 level control, which may shed new light on neural differentiation of P19 cells.

Xist recruits various chromatin remodelers, amongst them SPEN, which are involved in silencing of X-linked genes in cis and establishment of the Xi. Here, we show that SPEN plays an important role in the initiation of XCI. Spen null female mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are defective in Xist upregulation upon differentiation. We find that Xist-mediated SPEN recruitment to the Xi chromosome happens very early in XCI, and that SPEN-mediated silencing of the Tsix promoter is required for Xist upregulation. Accordingly, failed Xist upregulation in Spen-/- ESCs can be rescued by concomitant removal of Tsix. These findings indicate that SPEN is not only required for the establishment of the Xi, but is also crucial in the initiation of the XCI process.

The diversity of endothelial cells (ECs) is transcriptionally evident and ECs undergo dynamic changes in gene expression during vessel growth and remodelling.Here, we investigated the role of the histone acetyltransferase HBO1 (KAT7), which is important for activating genes during development and histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation (H3K14ac). Loss of HBO1 and H3K14ac impaired developmental sprouting angiogenesis and reduced pathological EC overgrowth in the retinal endothelium. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of retinal ECs revealed an increased abundance of tip cells in Hbo1 deleted retinas, which lead to EC overcrowding in the retinal sprouting front and prevented efficient tip cell migration. We found that H3K14ac was highly abundant in the endothelial genome in both intra- and intergenic regions suggesting that the role of HBO1 is as a genome organiser that promotes efficient tip cell behaviour necessary for sprouting angiogenesis.

Several pluripotency TFs have been linked to XCR through binding to the long non-coding RNA gene Xist, but whether other regulatory elements are involved is unclear. Here, we show that reprogramming to iPSCs induces gradual acquisition of chromatin accessibility at specific sites on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) which is subsequently propagated to other regulatory elements including enhancers and promoters. Regions that are genomically closer to day 0 accessible regions become biallelically accessible earlier, than the more distant ones. For distinct categories of chromatin regions that become biallelically accessible at different times, different sets of transcription factor (TF) motifs are enriched, including the pluripotency TFs KLF4 and cMYC. In addition, regions that become bialleliacally accessible earlier also show increased TF pluripotency binding, supporting the link between pluripotency TFs in XCR. To further explore the relationship between pluripotency TFs and XCR, we construct the active Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) during iPSC reprogramming using scRNA-seq and computational analyses. We reveal gene targets of 311 TFs expressed across reprogramming to iPSCs. Using this single-cell regulatory atlas, we show that X-linked genes are preferentially targeted by several pluripotency TFs. Our results suggest a new model where XCR may be coordinated by direct targeting of regulatory elements on the X chromosome by pluripotency TFs, concomitant with step-wise acquisition of chromatin accessibility. Altogether, our results demonstrate how gradual acquisition of a new GRN during reprogramming of cellular identity is linked with dynamic induction of chromatin accessibility and overcomes stable chromatin silencing on the Xi.

GSE153190	2021.09.30	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	8	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			RNA-sequencing of mouse mammary tumor organoids that were modified to generate knockout lines for SOX4	The transcription factor SOX4 is widely expressed during development and is essential to maintain progenitor pools in a variety of organs. In breast cancer SOX4 has been shown to be associated with poor survival and increased tumor size and metastasis formation. This has mostly been attributed to the ability of SOX4 to regulate Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT). However, SOX4 regulates target gene transcription in a plastic manner that is dependent on the cellular and epigenetic context. In this study we have investigated the loss of SOX4 in mammary tumor development utilizing organoids derived from a PyMT genetic mouse model. CRISPR-mediated loss of SOX4 led to a strong impairment in growth of primary mammary tumors and subsequent metastases through an EMT-independent mechanism. Instead, SOX4 is required for inhibiting differentiation by controlling genes that are highly activated in foetal mammary stem cells (fMaSC). These SOX4-dependent genes are associated with cell cycle progression, DNA biosynthesis, RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis suggesting that SOX4 controls active cycling of tumor cells. Analysis of genes co-expressed with SOX4 in the TCGA and METABRIC studies revealed that these cell cycle-related genes correlate with SOX4 expression in human tumors. Our study identifies a novel role for SOX4 in maintaining mammary tumors in an undifferentiated proliferative state.

GSE148606	2021.09.30	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			c-MAF defines the phenotype of a family of perivascular macrophages	Tissue-resident Macrophages have long been appreciated as playing a fundamental role in the ontogeny and function of several organs. For example, osteoclasts are crucial for proper bone remodeling, microglia for synaptic pruning, and lung alveolar macrophages for clearance of surfactant. Perivascular macrophages have been described in many organs. Our analysis of murine perivascular macrophages in several tissues and organs led us to define a macrophage family, whose members share the expression of a number of surface molecules that are not typically considered macrophage markers, such as Lyve1, Folate Receptor 2 (Folr2), Enpep/CD249, and CD38, as well as other more typical macrophage markers such as CD206 and Tim4. This family of perivascular macrophages also occurs in humans. Importantly, this family of perivascular macrophages relies on the transcription factor c-MAF, encoded by the gene Maf, for its full function. Conditional deletion of the Maf gene in the Lyve1+Folr2+CD38+ macrophage family caused their ablation in the brain, without impact on the microglia, while in the adipose tissue the conditional deletion of the Maf gene in perivascular macrophages resulted in a profoundly altered macrophage gene expression, and brought about an increased vascular branching in this tissue. Mice with conditional Maf deletion were protected from metabolic syndrome when submitted to high fat diet (HFD). Our results show that c-MAF is the master regulator of a family of perivascular macrophages.		epididymal white adipose tissue;Lyve1 CRE/+ x CMAF FLOX/FLOX;C57BL/6J (JAX Stock#: 0664);16 weeks old;B6;129P2-Lyve1tm1.1(EGFP/cre)Cys/J (JAX Stock#: 012601);WT x CMAF FLOX/FLOX;Normal Chow

The goals of this study are to compare the genes expression difference at transcriptome level; Methods: Total RNA was extracted from whole cells with the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and integrity were evaluated with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) ≥ 7 were considered to be of high quality and were processed further and subjected to subsequent analysis. Total RNA-seq libraries were generated using 4 μg of total RNA, which was analyzed using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LTSample Prep Kit. These libraries were then sequenced using the Illumina sequencing platform (HiSeqTM 2500 or Illumina HiSeq X Ten), and 125-bp/150-bp paired-end reads were generated. Results: The raw reads containing adaptors and the low-quality reads from the raw data were removed using Trimmomatic to obtain clean reads. Transcriptome sequencing was conducted by OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and clean reads were provided. The clean reads were mapped to the hg38 reference genome using hisat2 (version 2.1.0). The output BAM files were converted to SAM files using SAMtools 1.9. The final TPM values were obtained using Stringtie 1.3.5. Conclusions: To understand the mechanistic basis of GPI biosynthesis upregulation by the CD55 precursor, we performed RNA- sequencing (RNA-seq) of samples of parental PIGS-HRD1-DKO, PIGS-HRD1-CD55-TKO, and PIGS-HRD1-CD55-TKO stably overexpressed HA-CD55 stably overexpressing cells. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed. The expression profile of GPI biosynthesis -related genes was not significantly affected by CD55.		untreated;PIGS and HRD1-/-;HEK293 cells;PIGS-/-;Human Embryonic Kidney 293;PIGS, CD55, and HRD1-/-

By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.

Using a combination of RNA-seq and proteome analyses, we found that Acsbg1, a member of ACSL, is selectively expressed in Treg cells. Furthermore, we found that gene loci of Acsbg1 was epigenetically regulated and opened up by Smad2/3 in Treg cells. Deletion of Smad2/3 decreased expression levels of Acsbg1 compared to control T reg cells. We show that the genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of Acsbg1 causes not only mitochondrial dysfunction, but also dampens other metabolic pathways including glycolysis and the TCA-cycle. The extrinsic supplementation of sgAcsbg1 Treg cells with oleoyl-CoA restored the phenotype of the Treg metabolic signature. Furthermore, we also found evidence of this pathway in ST2+ effector Treg cells in the lung, which underlies the enhanced immunosuppressive capacity in the airway inflammation. This study provide a framework of Acsbg1 serving as a metabolic checkpoint governing Treg cell homeostasis and the resolution of lung inflammation.

Neurotensin (NT), a gut peptide localized predominantly to the small bowel and released by fat ingestion, stimulates the growth of intestinal mucosa under basal conditions and during periods of nutrient deprivation, suggesting a possible role for NT on ISC function. Methods: Lgr5-EGFP, NT wild type (Nt+/+) and Lgr5-EGFP, NT knockout (Nt-/-) mice were fed ad libitum (AL) or fasted for 48 h. Small intestine crypts were examined by RNAseq analysis. Results: Loss of NT impaired crypt cell proliferation and ISC function in a manner dependent on nutrient status. Under nutrient-rich conditions, NT stimulated the expression of genes that promote cell cycle progression, leading to crypt cell proliferation. Under conditions of nutrient depletion, NT stimulated WNT/β-catenin signaling and promoted an ISC gene signature, leading to enhanced ISC function. NT was required for the induction of WNT/β-catenin signaling and ISC-specific gene expression during nutrient depletion, and loss of NT reduced crypt cell proliferation and impaired ISC function and Lgr5 expression in the intestine during fasting. Conclusion: Collectively, our findings establish an evolutionarily conserved role for NT in ISC maintenance during nutritional stress.

A TLR5 agonist, entolimod, is among the most powerful experimental radiation countermeasures and shows efficacy in rodents and non-human primates as a prophylactic (radioprotection) and treatment (radiomitigation) modality. While the prophylactic activity of entolimod has been connected to suppression of radiation-induced apoptosis, the mechanism by which entolimod functions as a radiomitigator remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that, in contrast to radioprotection, neutrophils are essential for the radiomitigative activity of entolimod. We found that neutrophils express functional TLR5 and stimulation by entolimod is a key component to the mechanism of radiomitigation. Given that the underlying effects of TLR5 agonists have been associated with NF-kB-dependent transcriptional events, we hypothesized that changes in the transcriptional profile of neutrophils post-entolimod treatment mitigates radiation damage. However, RNA sequencing data analysis showed that ex vivo stimulation of neutrophils with entolimod for 30 minutes caused changes in transcriptional profiles that were substantially weaker – both in the number of responsive genes and scale of changes – as compared with that of liver cells following in vivo entolimod treatment. These observations suggest that mitigation of radiation damage by entolimod-stimulated neutrophils involves a transcriptional-independent mechanism.		entolimod;30min;wild type;female;neutrophils;male;vehicle

Our prior studies showed that quinacrine (QC), an antimalarial drug, enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity in treatment-refractory OC cells, including artificially generated chemoresistant and high-grade serous OC cells. In this study, we investigated QC-induced transcriptomic changes to uncover its cytotoxic mechanisms of action. Isogenic pairs of OC cells generated to be chemo-resistant and chemo-sensitive counterparts were treated with QC followed by RNAseq analysis. Validation of selected expression results and database comparison analyses indicated the ribosomal biogenesis (RBG) pathway is inhibited by QC. RBG is commonly upregulated in cancer cells and is emerging as a drug target. We found that QC attenuates the in vitro and in in vivo expression of nucleostemin (NS/GNL3), a nucleolar RBG and DNA repair protein, and the RPA194 catalytic subunit of Pol I that results in RBG inhibition and nucleolar stress. QC promotes the redistribution of fibrillarin in form of extranuclear foci and nucleolar caps, an indicator of nucleolar stress conditions. In addition, we found that QC-induced downregulation of NS disrupted homologous recombination repair both by reducing NS protein levels and parylation resulting in reduced RAD51 recruitment to DNA damage. Our data suggests that QC inhibits RBG and this inhibition promotes DNA damage by directly downregulating the NS-RAD51 interaction. Additionally, QC showed strong synergy with PARP inhibitors in OC cells. Overall, we found that QC by downregulates the RBG pathway, induces nucleolar stress, supports the increase of DNA damage, and sensitized cells to PARP inhibition, which supports new therapeutic stratagems for treatment-refractory OC. Our work offers support for targeting RBG in OC and determines NS to be a novel target for QC.		SKOV3;HeyA8;quinacrine 8uM;ovarian cancer cell line;resistant;control;sensitive;OV2008

However, the mechanisms underlying positive gene regulation mediated by Polycomb proteins are poorly understood. Here, we show that RING1B, a core component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1, regulates enhancer-promoter interaction of the bona fide estrogen-activated GREB1 gene. Systematic characterization of RNA:DNA hybrid formation (R-loops), nascent transcription, and RNA Pol II activity upon estrogen administration revealed a key role of RING1B in gene activation by regulating R-loop formation and RNA Pol II elongation. We also found that the estrogen receptor (ER) and RNA are both necessary for full RING1B recruitment to estrogen-activated genes. Notably, RING1B recruitment was mostly unaffected upon RNA Pol II depletion by triptolide. Our findings delineate the functional interplay between RING1B, RNA, and ER to safeguard chromatin architecture perturbations required for estrogen-mediated gene regulation, and highlight the crosstalk between steroid hormones and Polycomb proteins to regulate oncogenic programs.

We injected cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs in rabbits and monkeys either immediately after removing 8 mm of the central portion of the CE or a few days later when corneal edema developed. All clinical models developed deturgesced and clear corneas 2-3 weeks following the CEC injection and remained comparable to the CE of the untreated eye. Confocal scanning microscopy confirmed an intact structure of hexagonal/polygonal cells and immunohistochemical analysis illustrated a monolayer expressing barrier and pump function proteins in the regenerated CE. The necropsy examination confirmed no remarkable change in multiple tissues examined for teratoma formation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the efficacy of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs to form a functional CE on the denuded Descemet’s membrane.		human embryonic stem cell (hESC);hESC-derived corneal endothelial cells (CECs)

We recently reported that tyrosine phosphorylation activates IDH1 R132H mutant in AML cells. Here we show that, surprisingly, mutant IDH2 (mIDH2) R140Q commonly has K413-acetylation, which negatively regulates mIDH2 activity in human AML cells by attenuating dimerization and blocking binding of substrate (α-ketoglutarate) and cofactor (NADPH). Mechanistically, K413-acetylation of mitochondrial mIDH2 is achieved through a series of hierarchical phosphorylation events mediated by tyrosine kinase FLT3, which phosphorylates mIDH2 to recruit upstream mitochondrial acetyltransferase ACAT1 and simultaneously activates ACAT1 and inhibits upstream mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 through tyrosine- phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that the intrinsic enzyme activity of mIDH2 is much higher than mIDH1, thus the inhibitory K413-acetylation optimizes leukemogenic ability of mIDH2 in AML cells by both producing sufficient 2-HG for transformation and avoiding cytotoxic accumulation of intracellular 2-HG.

Here we utilized the system of directed neuroectoderm differentiation from human embryonic stem cells and identified KDM6B, an enzyme responsible to erase H3K27me3, was the most upregulated enzyme of histone methylation during neuroectoderm differentiation by transcriptome analysis. We then constructed KDM6B-null embryonic stem cells and found strikingly, the cells with KDM6B knockout exhibited much higher neuroectoderm induction efficiency. Furthermore, we constructed a serial of embryonic stem cell lines knocking out the other H3K27 demethylase KDM6A, and depleting both KDM6A and KDM6B, respectively. These cell lines together confirmed KDM6 impeded early neuroectoderm commitment. By RNA-seq, we found a panel of WNT activation genes significantly downregulated while WNT inhibiting genes significantly upregulated upon depletion of KDM6. Functional rescue assayed that WNT agonist could abolish the differential neuroectoderm induction due to manipulating KDM6 demonstrated WNT was the major downstream of KDM6 during early neural induction. Taken together, our findings illustrated the important role of histone methylation modifier KDM6A and KDM6B in neuroectoderm differentiation and provided additional insights into the precise epigenetic regulation in different stage of neurogenesis.

We determined that TNFR signlaing pathway plays a key role in lung injury and inflammation caused by O3 in mice. However, downstream molecular mechanisms underlying TNFR pathway have not been investigated. Methods: To investigate the role of TNFR pathway in gene expression changes, Tnfr1/2-deficient (Tnfr-/-) and wild-type (Tnfr+/+, C57BL/6J) mice were exposed to air or 0.3-ppm O3. Total RNAs were isolated from lung homogenates and cDNA microarray analyses were performed to elucidate TNFR-directed transcriptomics in basal lungs (air-exposed) as well as in the lung exposed to time course of O3 (24, 48, and 72 hr). Results: O3 caused time-dependent changes in lung gene expressions with the greatest transcriptome changes at 48-72 hr of exposure in Tnfr+/+ mice. At early time of exposure (24 hr), acute phase and inflammatory responses gene as well as redox and lipid metabolism genes were increased by O3 while cell cycle and DNA damage repair genes were markedly increased by O3 at later time points (48-72 hr). Compared to Tnfr+/+ mice, Tnfr-/- mice had lowered expression of inflammatory response and vascular disorder-related genes at baseline (air). After O3 exposure, Tnfr-/- had enhanced expression of immune and inflammatory genes at 24 hr, indicating compensatory or adpative poentiation of immunity in Tnfr-/- mice. At 48 hr of O3 exposure, Tnfr-/- mice showed suppressed expression of genes involved in epithelial proliferation, inflammatory cell influxes and epithelial injury, compared to Tnfr+/+ mice. At 72 hr of O3 exposure, neurodegeneration and neurotransmitter transport genes were suppressed in Tnfr-/- than in Tnfr+/+. Conclusion: Overall, deficiency of TNFR-mediated signaling in mouse lungs altered transcriptomes to protect lungs from O3-induced inflammation, cell proliferation, oxidative stress, and neuronal disorders.

We previously determined that lack of NF-kB signlaing pathway suppressed lung injury and inflammation caused by O3 in mice. The current study was to determine transcriptome mechanisms orchestrated by NF-kB during the development of pulmonary O3 injury. Methods: To investigate the role of NF-kB1 pathway in lung gene expression changes, Nfkb1-deficient (Nfkb1-/-) and wild-type (Nfkb1+/+) mice were exposed to air or 0.3-ppm O3. Total RNAs were isolated from lung homogenates and cDNA microarray analyses were performed to elucidate NF-kB1-directed transcriptomics in basal lungs (air-exposed) as well as in the lung exposed to O3 (48 hr). Results: In air-exposed Nfkb1-/- lungs, leukocyte extravasation/adhesion and antigen presentation genes were overexpressed while immunity genes were suppressed, supporting the dual role of Nf-kB1 homodimer as a transcriptional repressor as well as transcriptional activator and the phenotype of Nfkb1-/- mice (defective response to infection and specific antibody production). After O3 exposure. Nfkb1-/- mice showed suppressed expression of lung cell cycle genes and enhanced expression of DNA damage checkpoint regulation pathway genes, compared to Nfkb1+/+ mice.

A recent study used spheroids of MCF10 cells to model breast cancer progression and identified targetable alterations more similar to those in vivo. Thus, it is practical and essential to explore and characterize the spheroids of the commonly used human breast cancer (BC) cells. This study conducted Hi-C analyses in three-dimensional (3D) spheroids of MCF10A, MCF7 and MCF7TR cells and compared TADs and looping genes with those in 2D monolayers. We found that chromatin domains and looping genes’ strength have drastically changed during the 3D culture growth, although we identified very similar numbers of TADs and looping genes. We further identified novel 3D growth-specific looping genes within Hippo relevant pathways, of which two genes showed potential prognostic values in measuring the outcome of the endocrine treatment. We finally confirmed a few selected Hippo relevant pathways genes with enhanced looping in breast cancer patient tissues’ organoid. Hence, our work has provided significant insights into our understanding of 3D-growth-specific chromatin architecture in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.

During the transition from benign tumors to malignant carcinoma, tumor cells need to repress differentiation and acquire invasive features. Using transcriptional profiling of cancer stem cells (CSC) from benign tumors and malignant skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we identified the nuclear receptor NR2F2 as uniquely expressed in malignant SCC. Using genetic gain- and loss-of-function in vivo, we show that NR2F2 is essential for promoting the malignant tumor state by controlling tumor stemness and maintenance in mouse and human SCC. We demonstrate that NR2F2 promotes tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasive features, while repressing tumor differentiation and immune cell infiltration by regulating a common transcriptional program in mouse and human SCCs. Altogether, we identify NR2F2 as a key regulator of malignant CSC functions that promotes tumor renewal and restricts differentiation to sustain malignant tumor state.		human lung SCC cell line (Sk-MES-1) with NR2F2 deletion;NR2F2 KO;human lung SCC cell line (Sk-MES-1);NR2F2 WT

We exposed brain organoids to serum to mimic the serum exposure consequence of BBB breakdown in AD patient brains. The serum-exposed brain organoids were able to recapitulate AD-like pathologies, including increased Aβ aggregates and p-Tau level, synaptic loss, and impaired calcium signaling and neural network. Serum exposure increased Aβ and p-Tau levels through inducing BACE and GSK3α/β levels, respectively. In addition, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain organoids revealed that serum exposure reduced synaptic function in both neurons and astrocytes, and induced immune response in astrocytes.

Key in this cross-talk are bile acids, which are secreted from the liver into the intestine and, via the enterohepatic circulation, reach back to the liver. Important new insights have been gained in the Farnesoid X receptor (Fxr)-mediated communication from intestine-to-liver in health and disease. However, liver-to-intestine communication and the role of bile acids and FXR in this cross talk remain elusive. Here, we analyse Fxr-mediated liver-to-gut communication, and its consequences in the colon. Mice in which Fxr was selectively ablated in intestine (Fxr-intKO), the liver (Fxr-livKO), or in the full body (Fxr-totKO) were engineered. The effects on colonic gene expression (RNA sequencing), on the microbiome (16S rRNA Gene Sequencing) and on mucus barrier were analyzed. Compared to Fxr-intKO and Fxr-totKO mice, more genes were differentially expressed in the colons of Fxr-livKO mice relative to control mice (731, 1824 and 3272 respectively), suggestive of a strong role of hepatic Fxr in liver-to-gut communication. The colons of Fxr-livKO showed increased expression of anti-microbial genes, such as Regenerating islet-derived 3 beta and gamma (Reg3β and Reg3γ), Toll-like receptors (Tlrs), inflammasome related genes and differential expression of genes belonging to the ‘Mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis’ pathway. Compared to control mice, Fxr-livKO mice have decreased levels of the predicted mucin degrading bacterium Turicibacter and a concomitant increase in the thickness of the inner sterile mucus layer. In conclusion, ablation of Fxr in the liver has a major effect on colonic gene expression, the gut microbiome and on the permeability of the mucus layer. This stresses the importance of the Fxr-mediated liver-to-gut signaling.		Fxr-fl/fl;Fxr-livKO;colon;Fxr-intKO;colon tissue;Fxr-totKO;male;C57Bl6

In this study, we revealed that activation of AKT in somatic cells undergoing reprogramming enhances epigenetic reprogramming. Activated AKT in reprogramming cells triggers elevated anabolic glucose metabolism, and, accordingly, increases the level of α-ketoglutarate (αKG) which is an essential cofactor for the enzymatic activity of the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) dioxygenase TET. Additionally, the level of TET was upregulated. Consistent with upregulated KG production and TET, we observed a genome-wide increase in 5-hydorxymethylcytosine (5hmC) which is an intermediate in the DNA demethylation process. Moreover, DNA methylation level at ES-cell super-enhancers of pluripotency-related genes was significantly decreased, leading upregulation of associated genes. Taken together, our results indicate that AKT signaling is associated with epigenetic regulation by hyperactivating TET at catalytical and transcriptional levels during the somatic cell reprogramming.

Additionally, the level of TET was upregulated. Consistent with upregulated KG production and TET, we observed a genome-wide increase in 5-hydorxymethylcytosine (5hmC) which is an intermediate in the DNA demethylation process. Moreover, DNA methylation level at ES-cell super-enhancers of pluripotency-related genes was significantly decreased, leading upregulation of associated genes. Taken together, our results indicate that AKT signaling is associated with epigenetic regulation by hyperactivating TET at catalytical and transcriptional levels during the somatic cell reprogramming.		mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs);E13.5 embryos;mixed; C57BL/6, DBA/2, and ICR;Oct4-EGFP transgenic mouse;Mock administration;Reprogramming MEFs_10 dpi_-4OHT;Reprogramming MEFs_10 dpi_+4OHT;male;4OHT administration

Despite the major involvement of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) in cell-fate determination, few have examined them for their involvement in fundamental processes that require EMT. Here, we have identified Max network transcription repressor (MNT) as a potent EMT promoting TF in mammary epithelium. We show that depletion of MNT blocked TGF?-induced phenotypic changes, and transcriptomic analysis revealed that MNT is a transcription repressor of epithelial identity. We show that MNT mediates repression of epithelial identity via direct interaction with HDAC1. Lastly, we show that MNT and its target genes are heavily expressed in EMT-High breast cancer, with MNT required for breast cancer cell migration. Taken together, these findings establish MNT as a critical regulator of cell-fate determination and the EMT transcriptome.

Thus, small molecules targeting WDR5 represent an attractive strategy for anti-cancer interventions. However, currently available inhibitors designed to interfere with WDR5 binding to a specific partner (such as OICR-9429 that blocks WDR5-MLL interaction) show a promising but rather partial therapeutic effect, presumably due to incomplete blockade of WDR5 functionality and interactions with various partners. Here, we report the first-in-class, OICR-9429-based proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) of WDR5, including a prototypic compound MS33 and a further optimized MS67, that achieve specific and efficient depletion of WDR5 in cancer cells. Such an effect is not seen with OICR-9429 or MS33/67 analogs that are incapable of E3 ligand conjugation. Medicinal chemistry, structural and cellular characterizations demonstrate that MS33 and MS67 bind both WDR5 and an E3 ligand VHL tightly, with MS67 showing a unique cooperative binding, an event that subsequently induces degradation of WDR5 through a VHL- and proteasome-dependent mechanism. Global proteomics profiling shows a highly specific effect of MS67 on WDR5. Genomics analysis further demonstrates that, relative to non-degrading inhibitors, MS67 is far more potent in suppressing overall transcription of WDR5-regulated genes crucially involved in oncogenesis and in reducing global H3K4 methylation, an enzymatic product of MLL/WDR5 complex. Importantly, using a panel of human MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (MLL-r AML) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, we found that, relative to non-degrading inhibitor controls, MS67 displays a superior anti-growth effect. MS67 also demonstrates optimal PK/PD properties in vivo and treatment with MS67 significantly suppressed tumorigenesis of MLL-r AML in tumor xenografted animal models. Together, this study reports the first-in-class PROTACs of WDR5 and demonstrates its advantageous efficacies in the treatment of WDR5-dependent cancers.

In this study we provide a method to isolate the leptomeningeal cell layer, identify leptomeninges in histologic slides, and maintain leptomeningeal fibroblasts in in vitro culture. Using an array of transcriptomic, histological, and cytometric analyses, we identified ICAM1 and SLC38A2 as two novel markers of leptomeningeal cells in vivo and in vitro. Our results confirm the fibroblastoid nature of leptomeningeal cells and their ability to form a sheet-like layer that covers the brain and spine parenchyma. These findings will enable researchers in central nervous system barriers to describe leptomeningeal cell functions in health and disease.		pia enriched fraction;vehicle-treated mice

Eight pregnant female mice (gestation days 19-20) were placed in a smoking chamber that served as a CS-exposed group. The mothers and newborn pups were exposed to CS for five hours/day, five days/week for 110 days. In parallel, mice were kept in normal cages that served as a control group. The ocular lenses were isolated and fiber cells were separated from the lens epithelium under a microscope. The control and CS-exposed groups were maintained in four biological replicates each consisting of a pool of lens fiber cells from four eyes. The eight biological replicates (four control and four CS-exposed) of fiber cells were used for the next-generation-based transcriptome (RNA-Seq) sequencing, mass-spectrometry-based proteome, and metabolome profiling. RNA-Seq analysis identified the expression (≥1.0 FPKM) of 9,590 and 9,531 genes in control and CS-exposed fiber cells, respectively. The analysis identified 348 differentially expressed genes, which included 186 downregulated and 162 upregulated genes in CS-exposed fiber cells. Proteome profiling revealed a total of 2,424 proteins in control and CS-exposed fiber cells. Metabolome profiling identified a total of 280 metabolites, marked with decreased levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)-related metabolites in CS-exposed fiber cells. In conclusion, we have established a comprehensive omics profile of CS-exposed lens fiber cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report investigating a comprehensive omics profile of CS-exposed fiber cells.		control (CT-FC);Ocular lens fiber cells;Ocular lens;cigarette smoke (CS-FC) exposed;Lens fiber cells from cigarette smoke exposed mice;C57BL/6;Lens fiber cells from control mice

However, the characterization of PWM subpopulations is still insufficient. Here we show that ACSA-2 (Astrocyte Cell Surface Antigen-2) is an intrinsic marker of astrocyte-committed precursors. In the developing cerebellum, the ontogeny of ACSA-2+ astrocytes revealed this epitope to be exclusively expressed by PWM cells. By contrast, in the adult brain, ACSA-2 is observed on parenchymal astrocytes, fibrous astrocytes of the white matter and at low level on Bergmann glia. In combination with GLAST, a marker for astroglia-like progenitors, we addressed the characteristics of neurogenic (ACSA-2-/GLAST+) and astrocyte-committed (ACSA-2+/GLAST+) precursors using transcriptomics and cell transplantation assays. Gene expression analyses identified major differences in genes related to the maturation status of astrocytes, their potential to generate interneurons and genes required for Bergmann glia specification. Transplantation assays further confirmed a divergent differentiation potential: ACSA-2+/GLAST+ cells, on the one side, differentiate into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes but not into Bergmann glia or neurons when transplanted into the neonatal cerebellum. On the other side, ACSA-2-/GLAST+ progenitors were able to generate interneurons and all the glial phenotypes. Moreover, ACSA-2-/GLAST+ progenitors even maintained the neurogenic potential when transplanted into the adult cerebellum. In conclusion, this work reports about ACSA-2, a marker for glial-restricted precursors of the PWM that in combination with GLAST enables for the discrimination and isolation of neurogenic and astrocyte-committed progenitors of the neonatal cerebellum.

GSE184842	2021.09.28	Homo sapiens	GPL11154	TRUE	FALSE	7	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			YTHDF1-regulated oncogenic translation program offers a therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukemia	N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant modification in mRNAs, has been defined as a crucial modulator in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), while the detailed mechanism remains elusive. Here we report that YTHDF1, an m6A reader protein, is overexpressed in human AML samples with enrichment in leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Whereas YTHDF1 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis in mice, depletion of YTHDF1 attenuates self-renewal and proliferation of patient-derived LSCs, and impedes leukemia establishment in immunodeficient mice. Mechanistically, YTHDF1 promotes the translation of diverse m6A-modified oncogene mRNAs particularly cyclin E2. We applied a structure-based virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs and identified tegaserod as a potential YTHDF1 inhibitor. Tegaserod blocks the direct binding of YTHDF1 with m6A-modified mRNAs and inhibits YTHDF1-regulated mRNA translation. Moreover, tegaserod inhibits leukemogenesis in vitro and in mice, phenocopying the loss of YTHDF1. Together, our study defines YTHDF1 as an integral regulator of AML progression at the translational level and identifies tegaserod as a potential therapeutic agent for AML by targeting YTHDF1.		untreated;anti-m6A (Synaptic Systems, 202003);YTHDF1 knockdown;Peripheral blood;none

We show that the expression of beta cells markers decreased and dedifferentiation markers increased when beta cells were cultured in conditioned medium derived from omental stromal cells. We report that stromal cells with a high pro-inflammatory profile had the most severe impact.

But these methods are difficult to adopt in labs, and often result in impurity and heterogeneity of cells. This limits the power of organ-chips in making accurate physiological predictions. In this study, we report the use of blood-derived endothelial cells as alternatives to primary and iPSC-derived endothelial cells. Briefly, the genotype, phenotype and organ-chip functional characteristics of blood-derived outgrowth endothelial cells were compared against commercially available and most used primary endothelial cells and iPSC-derived endothelial cells. Through RNA sequencing we observe differences in gene expression profiles between different sources of endothelial cells, however blood-derived cells are relatively closer to primary cells than iPSC-derived suggesting that blood-derived endothelial cells may serve as an equally effective cell source for functional studies and organ-chips compared to primary cells or iPSC-derived cells.

A heterozygous histone H3.3K27M mutation has been shown to occur in ~80% of DIPGs, and results in brainstem gliomagenesis. There is no clinical trial for the patients with DIPG that proved to prolong survival time so far. Recently, CDK4/6 inhibitor showed feasibility and early therapeutic effect against DIPG. Also, recent research with human DIPG specimens have detected the MAPK pathway highly activated. Here, we evaluated a novel combination therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitor and MEK inhibitor to the mouse DIPG model. In order to generate DIPG‐bearing mice, we are using the RCAS/Tv‐a system, with which we are able to target specific genetic alterations in RCAS viruses (avian retroviruses) to specific cells‐of‐origin using transgenic Tv‐a‐expressing mice (Tv‐a being the receptor for RCAS viruses). We injected P3‐P5 Nestin-Tv-a;p53fl/fl mice (C56Bl/6 background) with RCAS‐PDGF‐A + RCAS‐H3.3K27M, and RCAS-Cre. The mice are treated with vehicle (methylcellurose), ribociclib as monotherapy, trametinib as monotherapy, and ribociclib and combination as combination. For short-term use, tumor tissues treated with ribociclib showed cytostatic effect, and those treated with trametinib showed cytotoxic effect, and those with combination showed both. Long-term use showed that combination therapy modestly prolonged mice survival compared with vehicle. Therefore, we need to find how DIPG showed registence to the long-term chemotherapy.

Primary cells such as hepatic stellate cells, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes are ideal experimental systems to study IL11 signalling in vitro. In contrast to immortalized cell lines, primary cells better capture physiologically relevant cellular physiology and pathobiology. This collection of protocols details experimental and culturing conditions for primary cells that preserve meaningful cellular states and physiological responses ex vivo in conventional 2D cell culture systems. Our data suggest that cell type, cell culture conditions, passage number, concentrations of stimuli, timing, and other factors have major implications for studies of IL11 signalling. In vitro experiments with primary cell material need to be planned and executed with great caution. Otherwise, physiologically relevant mechanisms may become dysfunctional, and reproducible experimental artefacts can obscure our view of true cytokine biology.

Methods: Thymi, mediastinal adipose tissue, and aortic arches of five female, 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were collected and pooled. Aortic arches and mediastinal adipose tissue were digested as previously described (PMID: 14597735) and single cell suspensions were generated from all three tissues. Four pools were generated per tissue. 400 viable CD4+CD8b+TCRb- cells were sorted into 8ul low-input lysis buffer containing RNaseH inhibitor, dNTPs, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in replicates. Material of 200 cells was reverse transcribed and amplified. Illumina libraries were prepared and sequenced. Results: A total of 2147 genes were differentially regulated between the different DP populations. Extrathymic DPs had 858 genes upregulated and 1284 genes downregulated compared to thymic DPs. 94 genes were commonly regulated in the two extrathymic DP subsets, whereas 23 genes were uniquely expressed in MAT DPs, 31 different genes were exclusively expressed in aortic arch DPs.

Using a mouse model harboring NRasG12D and EZH2 mutations that recapitulates leukemic progression, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to map cellular composition and gene expression alterations in healthy or diseased bone marrows during leukemogenesis. At cellular level, NRasG12D induces myeloid-biased differentiation and EZH2-deficiency impairs myeloid cell maturation, whereas they cooperate to promote myeloid expansion with dysregulated transcriptional programs. At gene level, NRasG12D and EZH2-deficiency independently and synergistically control gene expression in single cells. We integrated results from histopathology, leukemia repopulation, and leukemia-initiating cell assays to validate transcriptome-based cellular profiles. We used this resource to relate developmental hierarchies to leukemia phenotypes, evaluated oncogenic cooperation at single-cell and single-gene levels, and identified GEM as a new regulator of leukemia-initiating cells.

Among these sncRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) mostly originate from intron splicing in humans and are central to posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Yet, the characterization of the complete repertoire of sncRNAs in a given cellular context and the functional annotation of the human transcriptome are far from complete. Here, we report the large-scale identification of sncRNAs in the size range of 50 to 200 nucleotides, without a priori on their biogenesis, structure and genomic origin, in the context of normal human muscle cells. We provided a complete set of experimental validation of novel candidate snoRNAs by evaluating the prerequisites for their biogenesis and functionality, leading to their validation as genuine snoRNAs. Interestingly, we also found intergenic snoRNAs, which we showed are in fact integrated into candidate introns of unannotated transcripts or degraded by the Nonsense Mediated Decay pathway. Hence, intergenic snoRNAs represent a new type of landmark for the identification of new transcripts that have gone undetected because of low abundance or degradation after the release of the snoRNA.

Here, our single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses of three spinal ependymoma subtypes dissect the microenvironmental landscape of spinal ependymomas and reveal tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subsets with distinct functional phenotypes. CCL2+ TAMs are related to the immune response and exhibit a high capacity for apoptosis, while CD44+ TAMs are associated with tumor angiogenesis. By combining these results with those of single-cell ATAC-sequencing data analysis, we reveal that TEAD1 and EGR3 play roles in regulating the functional diversity of TAMs. We further identify diverse characteristics of both malignant cells and TAMs that might underlie the different malignant degrees of each subtype. Finally, assessment of cell-cell interactions reveal that stromal cells act as extracellular factors that mediate TAM diversity. Overall, our results reveal dual functions of TAMs in tumor progression, providing valuable insights for TAM-targeting immunotherapy.		ependymoma;human ependymoma

Diurnal feeding-fasting cycles result in substrate availability fluctuations which, together with increased energetic demand during the active period, impose a need for rhythmic cardiac metabolism. The nuclear receptors REV-ERBa and b are essential repressive components of the molecular circadian clock and major regulators of metabolism. To investigate their role in the heart, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific deletion of both Rev-erbs, which died prematurely due to dilated cardiomyopathy. Loss of Rev-erbs markedly downregulated fatty acid oxidation genes prior to overt pathology, which was mediated by induction of the transcriptional repressor E4BP4, a direct target of cardiac REV-ERBs. E4BP4 directly controls circadian expression of Nampt and its biosynthetic product NAD+ via distal cis-regulatory elements. Thus, REV-ERB-mediated E4BP4 repression is required for Nampt expression and NAD+ production by the salvage pathway. Together, these results highlight the indispensable role of circadian REV-ERBs in cardiac gene expression, metabolic homeostasis and function.

GSE128902	2021.09.28	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Distinct contributions of KAT2A histone acetyl-transferase complexes to human erythropoiesis [RNA-seq]	KAT2A is a histone acetyl-transferase involved in stabilization of transcriptional activity through acetylation of lysine residue 9 of Histone 3. Mouse knockout models suggest that Kat2a is dispensable for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell activity, despite a central role in survival and maintenance of Acute Myekoid Leukaemia cells through block of differentiation. Herein, we investigate KAT2A activity in human cord blood haematopoiesis and identify a specific requirement in the establishment of the erythroid lineage. KAT2A is required for specification and survival of Erythroid-Megakaryocytic progenitors, with regulation of expression of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) gene, which participates in lineage commitment, as well as of later effector genes in the platelet and erythroid lineages. Early and late lineage roles can be distinctly attributed to the ATAC and SAGA complexes in which context KAT2A exerts its activity. ATAC is active earlier in erythroid lineage development and mediates MEP specification from HSC, whilst SAGA activity is required post-commitment, including in expression of haemoglobin genes. We thus position KAT2A as a novel regulator of human erythropoiesis and separate early and later effects in lineage development with complex specificity. This has implications for putative therapeutic targeting of KAT2A complexes in leukaemia.		KAT2A;Cord blood cells;Control non-targeting;CD34+ HSC and progenitors

An emerging view is that cancer cells can develop a strong addiction to discrete molecular regulators that control these aberrant transcription programs, making these attractive targets for effective and enduring therapies. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein HuR as a central oncogenic driver for Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), which are highly aggressive sarcomas that originate from cells of the Schwann cell lineage. These neoplasms are strongly metastatic, resistant to radio-and chemotherapy and are typically fatal with no effective treatment. We find that HuR is highly elevated and binds to a multitude of cancer-associated transcripts in human MPNST samples. HuR inhibition has potent cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on tumour growth, and strongly supresses their metastatic capacity in vivo. Importantly, we find that the profound anti-tumorigenic effects of HuR stems from its unique ability to regulate multiple key oncogenic signals that ultimately converge on highly intricate transcription regulatory networks that coordinate the core biological capabilities of MPNST cells. The exceptional dependency on HuR thus confers a competitive advantage to MPNST cells for their survival, proliferation and dissemination, representing an ideal target that could be exploited for MPNST treatment.

The goals of this study are to compare adhesion gene clusters and clock genes / biomarkers at different time points throughout the day in sorted murine lympahtic endothelial cells. Methods: RNA of sorted dermal LECs harvested in TriZol-LS was purified using Direct-zol RNA mini Prep Kit (ZymoResearch) following manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated RNA was quantified using the Nanodrop (Thermofisher) and analyzed on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using the RNA 6000 Nano or Pico Kit (Agilent). 75 ng of eluted total RNA was digested with DNase (Thermofisher) to remove DNA contaminations. An additional purification step with RNAClean XP Beads (Agencourt) was performed. The purified, bead-bound RNA was directly used as input in the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (TaKaRA Bio). Full-length cDNA was generated following manufacturer’s instructions. Full-length cDNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen) with the Qubit fluorometer. Finally, sequencing libraries were generated using 500 pg full-length cDNA following the NexteraXT protocol (Illumina). Libraries were quantified on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using the DNA 1000 Kit (Agilent) and sequenced on a HiSeq1500 system (Illumina) with a readlength of 100 nt, single-end mode. Results: obtained transcriptome profiles were processed on a Galaxy web interface hosted by LAFUGA (Gene Center, Munich). After demultiplexing and trimming data was mapped against the mouse genome (mm10) using RNA-STAR mapper (Galaxy Version 2.5.2b-0). Abundant reads were counted using HTSeq-count (Galaxy Version 1.0.0). Afterwards, gene expression analysis to detect differentially expressed genes was performed using DESeq2 (Galaxy Version 2.11.40.6), setting the false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05. Comparing the expression profiles and the enrichment of gene ontology cluster adhesion revealed a highly time-of-day dependent expression profile of genes. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of time-of-day dependent lymphatic endothelial cell transcriptomes, with respect to adhesion and clock genes. This will provide valid input into chronotherapy, timed delivery of substances and new therapeutic avenues.		post natal day 56;Skin, sorted lymphatic endothelial cells;ZT1;ZT13;ZT19;Skin;wild type;ZT7;C57BL/6

FUS BBBD also elicits secondary responses capable of augmenting immunotherapies, clearing amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau, and driving neurogenesis. Leveraging these secondary effects will benefit from an understanding of how they correlate to the magnitude of FUS BBBD and are differentially affected by the mechanical and biochemical stimuli imparted during FUS BBBD. Microbubble activation (MBA) and contrast enhancement (CE) differentially predicted expression of 1,124 genes 6 h or 24 h later. While there existed overlap in the transcripts correlated with MBA vs CE, MBA was principally predictive of expression of genes associated with endothelial reactivity while CE chiefly predicted sterile inflammation gene sets. Over-representation analysis identified transcripts not previously linked to BBBD, including actin filament organization, which is likely important for BBB recovery. Transcripts and pathways associated with neurogenesis, microglial activation, and amyloid-β clearance were significantly correlated to BBBD metrics.

The controls were from Mould KJ, et al. Airspace Macrophages and Monocytes Exist in Transcriptionally Distinct Subsets in Healthy Adults. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2020. We used the R package Seurat to project cells unto Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) 2D space, identify cell clusters, and detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. Results: We focused our analysis on macrophages (excluding cell clusters going through the cell cycle). We first compared disease groups to healthy control Using False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted p<0.05 and absolute log fold change (log FC)>0.25. We identified 191, 242, and 234 DE genes within all macrophages for the comparisons of SarcP vs. Con, SarcR vs. Con, and CBD vs. Con, respectively, with 82 genes common to all three comparisons; 47 out of the 82 genes were common to all comparisons in regards to recruited macrophages. Conclusions: We focused this first single-cell transcriptome study in granulomatous lung disease on macrophages. This study offers investigators cell-specific transcriptional changes (genes and networks/pathways) to consider mechanisms of granulomatous disease and as potential drug targets.

GSE184715	2021.09.27	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Highly efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cardiomyocytes: spike protein-mediated cell fusion and its inhibition	Severe cardiovascular complications can occur in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in spontaneously beating human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor but not the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that mediates spike protein cleavage in the lungs. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection of hiPSC-CMs was prolific: viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC33 CMs, smooth walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65-90 nm particles with canonical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads in hiPSC-CMs we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm cell-to-cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin and furin-like proteases abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that disrupts the multibasic furin cleavage motif was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS42 CoV-2 replicates efficiently in hiPSC-CMs and furin and/or furin-like-protease activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform enables target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19.		human fibroblast-derived iPSCs_mock;human fibroblast-derived iPSCs_infection;human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs);mock infection;SARS-CoV-2/UW001/Human/2020/Wisconsin (UW-001) at MOI of 0.01 for 48hrs

Here we demonstrate that RUNX2 and BGLAP osteogenic genes coordinate histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2) and transcriptional elongation factor Pol II to regulate chromatin dynamic and gene transcription during osteogenesis. Mechanistically, melatonin favored osteogenic differentiation via the NSD2-mediated modification of H3K36me2 on the promoters of osteogenic driver genes in MSCs from the old donors.

Calycosin (Cal) is the major active component of Radix astragali and has been widely used to treat inflammation in clinical practice. However, whether Cal could ameliorate myocardial infarction (MI)-induced inflammation and fibrosis and precise mechanisms remain uncertain. The aim of this study is to explore the role of Cal in HF and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Methods: For in vivo experiments, rats underwent left anterior descending (LAD) artery ligation for HF model, and the cardioprotective effects of Cal were measured by echocardiographic assessment and histological examination. RNA-seq approach was applied to explore potential differential genes and pathways. For further mechanistic study, pro-inflammatory conditioned media (CM)-induced H9C2 cells injury model and TGFβ-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts model were applied to determine the regulatory mechanisms of Cal. Results: In vivo experiment, echocardiography results showed that Cal significantly improved heart function. GO and Reactome enrichment revealed that inflammation and fibrosis pathway are involved in Cal-treated group. KEGG enrichment indicated that PI3K-AKT pathway is enriched in the Cal-treated group. Further experiments proved that Cal alleviated cardiomyocyte inflammatory responses evidenced by down-regulating the expressions of phosphorylated IκB kinase α/β (p-IKKα/β), phosphorylated nuclear factor kapa B (p-NFκB) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Besides, Cal effectively attenuated cardiac fibrosis through the inhibitions of expressions and depositions of collagen I and collagen III. In vitro experiments, the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 could abrogate the anti-inflammation and anti-fibrosis therapeutic effects of Cal, demonstrating that the cardio-protective effects of Cal were mediated through upregulations of PI3K and serine/threonine kinase (AKT). Conclusion: Cal improves cardiac function against HF by inhibiting cardiomyocytes inflammation and fibroblasts fibrosis via activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway.

RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that hundreds to thousands of genes including interferon stimulated genes were differentially expressed in BMMs from these Cas9 strains compared to B6 upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, the NF-kB signaling axis and TRIF mediated necroptosis were also strongly reduced in response to LPS and poly (I:C). In contrast there were no defects in the responses of BMMs to ligands of the RIG-I, STING, TLR2, TLR9 and IFN receptors. The TLR3 and TLR4 signaling were observed in the B6 but not 129 background, and with Cas9 integrated at the Rosa26 but not H11 locus. However, integration at the Rosa26 site, CAG promoter-driven Cas9 or eGFP were not individually sufficient to cause the defect. Taken together this study suggests a putative TRIF-mediated defect in TLR-3/4 signaling in BMMs from commercially available and widely-used C57BL/6-Cas9-expressing mice.		untreated;Cas9 expressing mouse: Cas9-FZ : Jax Stock:026179;C57BL/6J, Jax Stock: 000664;Bone marrow derived macrophages;Bone marrow;Cas9 expressing mouse: Cas9-KR Jax Stock: 028555;6-12 weeks;2hr after LPS treatment
GSE184548	2021.09.27	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	20	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Progenitor-intrinsic metabolic sensing promotes hematopoietic homeostasis	RNA-sequencing was performed to look for transcriptional differences between wild-type and Mpc2-deficient granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Very few genes were dysregulated in knockout cells relative to wild-type. Gls Mpc2 double knockouts were additionally analyzed to examine extent of Gls and Mpc2 deletion relative to single knockouts. Paper abstract: Hematopoietic homeostasis is maintained by stem and progenitor cells in part by extrinsic feedback cues triggered by mature cell loss. We demonstrate a different mechanism by which hematopoietic progenitors intrinsically anticipate and prevent the loss of mature progeny through metabolic switches. We examined hematopoiesis in mice conditionally deficient in long-chain fatty acid oxidation (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, Cpt2), glutaminolysis (glutaminase, Gls), or mitochondrial pyruvate import (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2, Mpc2). While genetic ablation of Cpt2 or Gls minimally impacted most blood lineages, deletion of Mpc2 led to a sharp decline in mature myeloid cells. However, MPC2-deficient myeloid cells rapidly recovered due to a transient increase in myeloid progenitor proliferation. Competitive bone marrow chimera and stable isotope tracing experiments demonstrated that this proliferative burst was intrinsic to MPC2-deficient progenitors and accompanied by a metabolic switch to glutaminolysis. Thus, hematopoietic progenitors intrinsically adjust to metabolic perturbations independently of feedback from downstream mature cells to maintain homeostasis.

A number of pathological mechanisms that lead to motor neuron death have been identified, although there are many unknowns in the disease aetiology of ALS. Alterations in lipid metabolism are well documented in the progression of ALS, both at the systemic level and in the spinal cord of mouse models and ALS patients. The origin of these lipid alterations remains unclear. This study aims to identify early lipid metabolic pathways altered before systemic metabolic symptoms in the spinal cord of mouse models of ALS.

Mechanistically, ANP32B forms a repressive complex with and thus inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53 in hematopoietic cells, and p53 deletion rescues the functional defect in Anp32b-deficient HSCs. Of great interest, ANP32B is highly expressed in leukemic cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Anp32b deletion enhances p53 transcriptional activity to impair LSC function in a murine CML model and exhibits synergistic therapeutic effects with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in inhibiting CML propagation. In summary, our findings provide a novel strategy to enhance p53 activity in LSCs by inhibiting ANP32B and identify ANP32B as a potential therapeutic target in treating CML.

Butyrate, produced by the gut microbiota, has shown beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and may directly affect beta cell function, but the mechanisms are poorly described. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of butyrate on IL-1β-induced β cell dysfunction. We showed that long-term exposure of mouse islets to non-cytotoxic concentrations of IL-1β impaired insulin secretion and content and reduced proliferation. This dysfunction was prevented when the islets were exposed to butyrate and butyrate alone also boosted insulin secretion. In contrast, butyrate further downregulated the proliferation. To get a better indication of mechanisms of actions we investigated the global mRNA expression profiles using RNA sequencing. Our results indicated that the protective effects of butyrate are associated with upregulation of secretion/transport-related genes and downregulation of inflammatory genes induced by IL-1β. In addition, several cell cycle related genes were strongly inhibited by butyrate. In conclusion, butyrate plays an essential role in supporting beta cell function under inflammatory conditions, suggesting a potential for therapeutic use in treatment and prevention of T2D.

During the transition from benign tumors to malignant carcinoma, tumor cells need to repress differentiation and acquire invasive features. Using transcriptional profiling of cancer stem cells (CSC) from benign tumors and malignant skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we identified the nuclear receptor NR2F2 as uniquely expressed in malignant SCC. Using genetic gain- and loss-of-function in vivo, we show that NR2F2 is essential for promoting the malignant tumor state by controlling tumor stemness and maintenance in mouse and human SCC. We demonstrate that NR2F2 promotes tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasive features, while repressing tumor differentiation and immune cell infiltration by regulating a common transcriptional program in mouse and human SCCs. Altogether, we identify NR2F2 as a key regulator of malignant CSC functions that promotes tumor renewal and restricts differentiation to sustain malignant tumor state.

Existing inter-individual variations of the immune responses, due to environmental exposures and genetic factors, may be critical to the development or not of symptomatic disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2, and transcriptomic differences marking such responses may be observed even later, after convalescence. Herein, we performed genome-wide transcriptional whole-blood profiling to test the hypothesis that immune response-related gene signatures may differ between healthy individuals with prior entirely asymptomatic versus clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection, all of which developed an equally robust antibody response. Among 12.789 protein-coding genes analyzed, there were only six and nine genes with significantly decreased or increased expression, respectively, in those with prior asymptomatic infection (n=17, mean age 34 years) relatively to those with clinical infection (n=15, mean age 37 years). All six genes with decreased expression (IFIT3, IFI44L, RSAD2, FOLR3, PI3, ALOX15), are involved in innate immune response while the first two are interferon-induced proteins. Among genes with increased expression six are involved in immune response (GZMH, CLEC1B, CLEC12A), viral mRNA translation (GCAT), energy metabolism (CACNA2D2) and oxidative stress response (ENC1). Notably, 8/15 differentially expressed genes are regulated by interferons. Our results suggest that an intrinsically weaker expression of some innate immunityrelated genes may be associated with an asymptomatic disease course in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether a certain gene signature predicts, or not, those who will develop a more efficient immune response upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2, with implications for prioritization for vaccination, warrant further study.		anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody positive healthy individual;A;S;F;Healthly_seropositive_Clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection;M;Whole Blood;Healthly_seropositive_Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection

In our previous study, we documented eosinophil infiltration in association with characteristic muscle damage in the dystrophin-deficient (mdx) mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In this earlier study, we found that eosinophils did not promote formation of muscle lesions, as these persisted in eosinophil-deficient mdx.PHIL mice. To obtain additional insight into these findings, we performed RNA sequencing on eosinophils isolated from muscle tissue of mdx, IL5tg, and mdx.IL5tg mouse strains. We discovered profound up-regulation of classical eosinophil effector proteins (major basic protein-1, eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil-associated ribonucleases, or RNases) in eosinophils isolated from lesion-free muscle from IL5tg mice. By contrast, we observed significant upregulation of tissue remodeling genes, including proteases, extracellular matrix components, collagen, and skeletal muscle precursors, as well as the immunomodulatory receptor, TREM2, in eosinophils isolated from skeletal muscle tissue from the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse strain. The anti-inflammatory properties of TREM2 have been described in the monocyte/macrophage lineage; however, there are no previous studies documenting TREM2 expression in eosinophils. Here we show that TREM2 is critical for full growth and differentiation of bone marrow-derived eosinophil cultures and for full expression of toll-like receptor 4. Immunoreactive TREM2 was also detected on human eosinophils at levels that correlated with donor body mass index. Taken together, our findings provide important insight into the immunomodulatory and remodeling capacity of mouse eosinophils and the flexibility of their gene expression profiles in vivo.		mdx;eosinophils isolated from quadricep muscle infiltrates;adult

Herby, CDCs were disclosed as a heterogenic cell type with clear similarities to cardiac non-myocyte cell types, particularly to CFs and SMCs. Beyond a high proliferation capacity and upregulation of immune-related genes, CDCs exhibited a strong extracellular matrix synthesizing ability and also some angiogenic potential. Subsequently, infant patient derived CDCs were compared to adult CDCs, revealing that infant-CDC upregulated developmental and angiogenic processes. This study represents the first characterization of CDCs by sc-RNAseq and unravels their age-dependent molecular differences.

While it is well documented that the bone marrow niche regulates hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and hence the systemic leukocyte pool, it is less clear how cardiovascular disease affects the vasculature forming this niche. Here we show that arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction alter the anatomy and function of bone marrow vasculature. Hypertension and atherosclerosis instigated vascular fibrosis, leakage and endothelial dysfunction in the bone marrow. Myocardial infarction induced vascular leakage and bone marrow angiogenesis via Vegf signaling. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of the Vegf receptor 2 limited emergency hematopoiesis after myocardial infarction, indicating that new vasculature supports higher blood cell production. RNA-sequencing of bone marrow endothelial cells revealed inflammatory gene expression in mice with cardiovascular disease. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of interleukin 6 or versican, which were highly expressed in mice with atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction, respectively, reduced hematopoiesis and systemic myeloid cells. Taken together, cardiovascular disease affects the vascular bone marrow niche, thus influencing hematopoietic stem cell behavior and expanding innate immune cell supply to atherosclerotic plaque and ischemic myocardium.

Multiplexed in situ hybridization analysis confirmed the nonoverlapping expression patterns and revealed their topography within the DCN. We then probed the function of these neurons in further experiments and found that one of the two populations was associated with food intake. Our broader study defines a conserved satiation centre and neural mechanism that may represent a novel therapeutic target for the management of excessive eating.

Little is known about the role of histone methylation and demethylation in this process. To understand the role of JMJD2A, a trimethyl demethylase for histone 3 lysine 9 and 36, in cardiac hypertrophy, we generated heart specific JMJD2A deletion (JMJD2A hKO) and overexpression (JMJD2A-Tg) mouse lines. JMJD2A hKO and JMJD2A-Tg mice are viable and have no overt baseline phenotype. However, they have altered responses to cardiac stresses. While inactivation of JMJD2A in hKO mice resulted in an attenuated hypertrophic response to transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced pressure overload compared to that of control littermates, JMJD2A-Tg mice have exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy after TAC.		adult;heart
GSE169062	2021.09.26	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	7	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Single-cell analysis of pathology in Klinefelter syndrome and idiopathic male infertility	Klinefelter syndrome (KS), also known as 47,XXY,  is characterized by a distinct set of physiological abnormalities, commonly including infertility. The molecular basis for Klinefelter-related infertility is still unclear, largely due to the cellular complexity of the testis and the intricate endocrine and paracrine signaling that regulates spermatogenesis. Here, we demonstrate an analysis framework for dissecting human testis pathology that uses comparative analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the biopsies of 13 human donors. By comparing donors from a range of ages and forms of infertility, we generate gene expression signatures that characterize normal testicular function and distinguish clinically distinct forms of male infertility. Unexpectedly, we identified a subpopulation of Sertoli cells within multiple cases of KS that lack transcription from the XIST locus, with the consequence of increased X-linked gene expression compared to all other KS cell populations. By systematic assessment of known signaling pathways, we identify 72 pathways potentially active in testis, dozens of which appear upregulated in KS.  Altogether our data support a model of pathogenic changes in interstitial cells cascading from loss of X-inactivation in pubertal Sertoli cells, and nominate testicular GNRH1 as a dosage-sensitive factor secreted by Sertoli cells that may contribute to the process. Our findings demonstrate the value of comparative patient analysis in mapping genetic mechanisms of disease, and identify an epigenetic phenomenon in KS Sertoli cells that may prove important for understanding causes of infertility and sex chromosome evolution.

Flow cytometry remains one of the most versatile and high throughput approaches for single-cell analysis; however, manual interpretation of multidimensional data poses a challenge to capture full cellular diversity and provide reproducible results. We present FlowCT, a semi-automated workspace empowered to analyze large datasets that includes pre-processing, normalization, multiple dimensionality reduction techniques, automated clustering and predictive modeling tools. As a proof of concept, we used FlowCT to compare the T cell compartment in bone marrow (BM) vs peripheral blood (PB) of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (MM); identify minimally-invasive immune biomarkers of progression from smoldering to active MM; define prognostic T cell subsets in the BM of patients with active MM after treatment intensification; and assess the longitudinal effect of maintenance therapy in BM T cells. A total of 354 samples were analyzed and immune signatures predictive of malignant transformation in 150 smoldering MM patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.7; P <.001), and of progression-free (HR: 4.09; P <.0001) and overall survival (HR: 3.12; P =.047) in 100 active MM patients, were identified. New data also emerged about stem cell memory T cells, the concordance between immune profiles in BM vs PB and the immunomodulatory effect of maintenance therapy. FlowCT is a new open-source computational approach that can be readily implemented by research laboratories to perform quality-control, analyze high-dimensional data, unveil cellular diversity and objectively identify biomarkers in large immune monitoring studies.

CDH11 has previously been demonstrated to be associated with a number of fibrotic diseases, but its exact role in inflammation remains relatively unknown. In vivo models of atherosclerosis demonstrated altered immune cell profiles with CDH11-deficiency, including decreased circulating myeloid cell populations. In vitro studies of CDH11-deficient macrophages revealed increased expression of genes associated with migration, despite a functional decrease in migration, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms. RNAseq analysis also showed increased expression of MHC class II molecule genes in CDH11-/- macrophages, indicating that loss of CDH11 in macrophages could alter T cell populations through increased activation of CD4+ helper T cells. These results together indicate that CDH11 can alter the immune response, in part by impairing macrophage migration and by affecting T cell activation.

GSE163210	2021.09.26	Homo sapiens	GPL18573	TRUE	FALSE	5	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Cancer phylogenetics using single-cell RNA-seq data	To test if scRNA-seq contains sufficient phylogenetic information to reconstruct a population history of cancer, immunosuppressed NU/J mice were injected with human cancer cells (MDA-MB-231-LM2). The tumors that develop are derived from the same population and thus share a common ancestor, but evolved independently in each mouse and should form separate clades on reconstructed phylogenetic trees when analysed together. We explore and compare results of phylogenetic analyses based on both expression levels and SNVs called from our scRNA-seq data. Both techniques are shown to be useful for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between cells, refecting the clonal composition of a tumor. Without an explicit error model, standardized expression values appears to be more powerful and informative than the SNV values at a lower computational cost, due to being a by-product of standard expression analysis. Our results suggest that scRNA-seq can be a competitive alternative or useful addition to conventional scDNA-seq phylogenetic reconstruction. Our results open up a new direction of somatic phylogenetics based on scRNA-seq data. Further research is required to refne and improve these approaches to capture the full picture of somatic evolutionary dynamics in cancer.		human derived mouse explant CTC1;Circulating Tumor Cells;human derived mouse explant CTC2;human derived mouse explant T3;MDA-MB-231-LM2;Tumor;human derived mouse explant T1;human derived mouse explant T2

The major output nucleus of the basal ganglia is the striatum, and its functions are dependent on neuronal compartmentation, including into striosomes and matrix. Striatal projection neurons are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), all of which share basic molecular signatures but are subtyped by selective expression of receptors, neuropeptides, and other gene families. Neurogenesis of the striosome and matrix occurs in separate waves, but the factors regulating terminal neuronal differentiation following migration are largely unidentified. We performed RNA- and ATAC-seq on sorted murine striosome and matrix cells at postnatal day 3 and with a focus on the striosomal compartment, validated the localization and/or role of transcription factors and their regulator(s), previously not known to be associated with striatal development, including Irx1, Foxf2, Olig2 and Stat1. In addition, we validated the enhancer function of a striosome-specific open chromatin region located 15Kb downstream of the Olig2 gene. These data and the data bases provide novel tools to dissect the networks regulating MSN compartmentation and differentiation and thus pathways relevant to movement and cognition.		day 3;Striatum;Female;Male;Nr4a1-GFP positive;Nr4a1-GFP negative;C57BL/6

We identified G3BP1 as non-substrate interactor of SPOP. G3BP1 is a well-known oncogene in many cancer types, but its role in prostate cancer (PCa) remains largely elusive. We showed that G3BP1 functions as an upstream regulator and potent endogenous inhibitor of Cul3SPOP, suggesting a distinctive Cul3SPOP inactivation independent of SPOP mutations. Transcriptomic analysis together with functional studies revealed that the G3BP1-SPOP ubiquitin signaling axis is involved in PCa progression through activating AR signaling. Further, AR upregulates G3BP1 to potentiate feed-forward amplification of signaling through G3BP1-SPOP axis. Overall, we show G3BP1high PCa tumors constitute a new subset where G3BP1 inhibits Cul3SPOP function to upregulate AR signaling, and promotes tumorigenesis.		22Rv1_Ctrl;SPOP knockdown;22Rv1_siSPOP;Control;22Rv1;prostate cancer cell line;G3BP1 knockout;22Rv1_sgG3BP1

Analysis of the transcriptional profiles of developing thymocytes has shown that T-lineage commitment is associated with loss of early HSPC gene signatures and acquisition of T cell gene signatures. Less well understood are the epigenetic alterations that accompany or enable these transcriptional changes. Here, we show that the histone demethylase Lsd1 (Kdm1a) performs a key role in extinguishing the HSPC transcriptional program during thymocyte maturation. Massive up-regulation of progenitor genes in Lsd1 deficient thymocytes was associated with increased H3K4 tri-methylation at gene promoters. Deletion of Lsd1 caused a block in late T cell development and over-expression of Gfi1 and Blimp1 repressor targets including the checkpoint molecules PD-1, Ctla4 and Nrp1. These results reveal a critical function for Lsd1-mediated H3K4 demethylation in regulating gene expression during T cell development.

Patients with Activated-PI3Kd Syndrome (APDS) present with sinopulmonary infections, lymphadenopathy and CMV and/or EBV viremia, yet why patients fail to clear certain viral infections remains incompletely understood. Using patient samples and a mouse model (Pik3cdE1020K/+ mice), we demonstrate that, upon activation, Pik3cdE1020K/+ CD8+ T cells exhibit exaggerated features of short-lived effectors both in vitro and post-viral infection, including increased Fas-mediated apoptosis due to sustained FoxO1 phosphorylation and derepression of FasL. Activated Pik3cdE1020K/+ CD8+ T cells displayed enhanced mTORC1 and c-Myc signatures, accompanied by metabolic perturbations linked to an accelerated effector program. Conversely, Pik3cdE1020K/+ CD8+ T cells failed to sustain expression of proteins critical for maintenance of long-lived memory cells, including TCF1, and mounted inadequate memory responses in vivo. Strikingly, activated Pik3cdE1020K/+ CD8+ T cells exhibit altered transcriptional and epigenetic circuits characterized by a pronounced IL-2/STAT5 signature associated with heightened IL-2 responses that prevented differentiation to memory-like cells in the presence of IL-15. Our data position PI3Kd as a central hub integrating multiple signaling nodes that promote terminal CD8+ T cell effector differentiation at the expense of memory and long-lived T cell responses.

GSE135306	2021.09.25	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Targeting EYA2 tyrosine phosphatase activity in glioblastoma stem cells induces mitotic catastrophe	Glioblastoma ranks among the most lethal of primary brain malignancies, with glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) at the apex of tumor cellular hierarchies. Here, to discover novel therapeutic GSC targets, we interrogated gene expression profiles from GSCs, differentiated glioblastoma cells (DGCs), and neural stem cells (NSCs), revealing EYA2 as preferentially expressed by GSCs. Targeting EYA2 impaired GSC maintenance and induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and loss of self-renewal. EYA2 displayed novel localization to centrosomes in GSCs, and EYA2 tyrosine (Tyr) phosphatase activity was essential for proper mitotic spindle assembly and survival of GSCs. Inhibition of the EYA2 Tyr phosphatase activity, via genetic or pharmacological means, mimicked EYA2 loss in GSCs in vitro and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Supporting the clinical relevance of these findings, EYA2 portends poor patient prognosis in glioblastoma. Collectively, our data indicate that EYA2 phosphatase function plays selective critical roles in the growth and survival of GSCs, potentially offering a high therapeutic index for EYA2 inhibitors.

Here we show that FGF19, a gut hormone, is rapidly induced by bypass surgery in rodents and humans. Administration of FGF19 achieves remission of diabetes through mechanisms beyond weight loss in animal models of diabetes, supporting a role of FGF19 as part of hormonal changes that influence metabolism following surgery. Through an unbiased phenotypic screen in diabetic mice, we identified selective, safe and effective FGF19 analogues. Unexpectedly, FGF19 analogue failed to correct hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. In contrast, administration of FGF19 analogue resulted in rapid, robust and sustained improvement in liver fat content and histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, faithfully replicating effect of the surgery. Thus, our work identifies a strategy of replacing gastric bypass surgery by equally effective, but less invasive, treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

It remains elusive about whether Tuft cells participate in bacterial eradication. Here we identify Sh2d6 as a signature marker for CD45+ Tuft-2 cells. Tuft-2 cells are derived from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells but not bone marrow cells. Depletion of Tuft-2 cells is susceptible to bacterial infection. Tuft-2 cells quickly expand over bacterial infection and sense bacterial metabolite N-undecanoylglycine through vomeronasal receptor Vmn2r26. Mechanistically, Vmn2r26 engagement with N-undecanoylglycine activates GPCR-PLCγ2-Ca2+ signal axis, which initiates prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) production. PGD2 enhances mucus secretion of Goblet cells and induces antibacterial immunity. Moreover, Vmn2r26 signaling also promotes SpiB expression, which is responsible for Tuft-2 cell development and expansion over bacterial challenge. Our findings reveal a novel function of Tuft-2 cells in immunity against bacterial infection through Vmn2r26-mediated recognition of bacterial metabolites. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of Tuft-2 cells compared with non Tuft-2 epithelial cells under Shigella infection.

Currently, the role of m5C in cancer initiation and progression is gaining more and more research attention, but the detailed mechanism remains unclear. As an m5C methyltransferase with unique mRNA catalytic activity, NSUN2 was found to be highly expressed in multiple cancers including gastric, bladder, gallbladder, and breast cancers, suggesting NSUN2 might exert oncogenic properties through affecting m5C levels in cancer cells. Therefore, to understand the potential roles of RNA m5C modification in tumorigenesis of cervical cancer, we established NSUN2 stable knockdown CaSki cell, and perform RNA-seq and RNA-BisSeq to figure out the possible pathway involved in cervical cancer development.

GSE184615	2021.09.24	Mus musculus	GPL17021	TRUE	FALSE	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Hippocampal transcriptome analysis following environmental enrichment in a mouse model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder	Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in a spectrum of lifelong behavioral and cognitive deficits collectively known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). FASD is a major health burden in most societies, there is no cure, and the molecular mechanism involved in its development is poorly understood. Human neurodevelopment is a continuum that extends over two decades after birth, with the potential to influence outcomes both prenatally and postnatally. Here, we experimentally investigate if positive postnatal environment enrichment ameliorates behavioral deficits caused by ethanol exposure. Furthermore, we assessed if this modulation is associated with alterations in hippocampal gene expression. To accomplish this, we used a binge model of ethanol exposure followed by environmental enrichment in C57BL/6 mice to generate four groups of animals: (1) control mice raised in standard conditions, (2) mice raised in enriched environments, (3) ethanol-exposed mice raised in standard conditions, and (4) ethanol-exposed mice raised in enriched environments. The environmental enrichment includes larger home cages with more individuals for social interaction, regular exposure to novel items, and access to running wheels. Ethanol exposure results in anxiety-like behavior (light-dark box) as well as learning and memory deficits (Barnes maze) that are at least partially ameliorated by enrichment. Environmental enrichment also improves performance for individuals not exposed to ethanol. Ethanol exposure induces changes in adult hippocampal gene expression (RNA-Seq). Some of the changes in adult hippocampal gene expression following ethanol exposure are reversed by environmental enrichment. The results offer a potential mechanism of behavioral deficits caused by ethanol exposure, including the potential for amelioration after an FASD diagnosis.		postnatal day 70;enrichment;control;ethanol;Hippocampus;C57BL/6

Here, we follow such changes associated with mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and X inactivation by integrating, for the first time, allele-specific data obtained by high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and Hi-C. In differentiated cells, contact decay profiles, which clearly distinguish the active and inactive X chromosomes, reveal loss of the inactive X-specific structure at mitosis followed by a rapid reappearance, suggesting a bookkeeping mechanism. In differentiating embryonic stem cells, changes in contact decay profiles are detected in parallel on both the X chromosomes and autosomes, suggesting profound simultaneous reorganization. The onset of the inactive X-specific structure in single cells is notably delayed relative to that of gene silencing, consistent with the idea that chromatin compaction is a late event of X inactivation. Novel computational approaches to effectively align single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and 3D chromosome structure reveal that long-range structural changes to chromosomes appear as discrete events, unlike progressive changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.		https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBSN8S56YA/;biosource_summary: F121-6-CASTx129;Day 11 F121-6 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;biosource_summary: F121-6-CASTx129 differentiated to neuronal stem cell;F123-CASTx129;neuronal stem cell;Day 0 F123 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;in vitro differentiated cells;Neural precursor cells derived from day 11 F123 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;Day 7 F121-6 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;Day 3 F123 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBSKX6CWM2/;biosource_summary: F123-CASTx129;Day 3 F121-6 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;Gilbert Lab;Day 7 F123 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;stem cell;https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBSSCN52FF/;F121-6-CASTx129;biosource_summary: F121-6-CASTx129 differentiated to embryoid body;Day 11 F123 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;female;biosource_summary: F123-CASTx129 differentiated to embryoid body;https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBSCXR3D9N/;stem cells;biosource_summary: F123-CASTx129 differentiated to neuronal stem cell;https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBS4NJWZ5W/;https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBSGQREXVY/;https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBSBQO3JYF/;embryoid body;Neural precursor cells clonally derived from day 11 F121-6 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;129/Sv X Cast;https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBSTESOFIF/;https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBSO5TMRP9/;https://data.4dnucleome.org/biosamples/4DNBS79QO1P6/;Day 0 F121-6 cells from an embryoid body differentiaton time course experiment;None;male

By screening a small molecule library of epigenetics-based therapeutics, BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) were identified as agents that sensitize tumor cells to the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T-cells. BETi modulated tumor cells to be sensitized to the cytotoxic effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF. By preventing the recruitment of BRD4 to p65-bound cis-regulatory elements, BETi suppressed the induction of inflammatory gene expression, including the key NF-B target genes BIRC2 (cIAP1) and BIRC3 (cIAP2). Disruption of pro-survival NF-B signaling by BETi led to unrestrained TNF-mediated activation of the extrinsic apoptotic cascade and tumor cell death. Administration of BETi in combination with T-cell bispecific (TCB) antibodies increased bystander killing of tumor cells and enhanced tumor growth inhibition in vivo in a TNF-dependent manner. This novel epigenetic mechanism of immunomodulation may guide future use of BETi as adjuvants for immune oncology agents.

Here, we follow such changes associated with mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and X inactivation by integrating, for the first time, allele-specific data obtained by high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and Hi-C. In differentiated cells, contact decay profiles, which clearly distinguish the active and inactive X chromosomes, reveal loss of the inactive X-specific structure at mitosis followed by a rapid reappearance, suggesting a bookkeeping mechanism. In differentiating embryonic stem cells, changes in contact decay profiles are detected in parallel on both the X chromosomes and autosomes, suggesting profound simultaneous reorganization. The onset of the inactive X-specific structure in single cells is notably delayed relative to that of gene silencing, consistent with the idea that chromatin compaction is a late event of X inactivation. Novel computational approaches to effectively align single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and 3D chromosome structure reveal that long-range structural changes to chromosomes appear as discrete events, unlike progressive changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### This SuperSeries is

Current treatments of sepsis are largely supportive and clinical trials using specific pharmacotherapy for sepsis have failed to improve outcomes. Here, we used the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse RAW264.7 cell line and AlphaLisa assay for TNFa as a readout to perform a supervised drug repurposing screen for sepsis treatment with compounds targeting epigenetic enzymes, including kinases. We identified the SCH772984 compound, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 inhibitor, as an effective blocker of TNFa production in vitro. RNA-Seq of the SCH772984-treated RAW264.7 cells at 1, 4, and 24 h time points of LPS challenge followed by functional annotation of differentially expressed genes highlighted the suppression of cellular pathways related to the immune system. SCH772984 treatment improved survival in the LPS-induced lethal endotoxemia and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse models of sepsis, and reduced plasma levels of Ccl2/Mcp1. Functional analyses of RNA-seq datasets for kidney, lung, liver, and heart tissues from SCH772984-treated animals collected at 6 h and 12 h post-CLP revealed a significant downregulation of pathways related to the immune response and platelets activation but upregulation of the extracellular matrix organization and retinoic acid signaling pathways. Thus, this study defined transcriptome signatures of SCH772984 action in vitro and in vivo, an agent that has the potential to improve sepsis outcome		9.5;8.6;N/A;8.7;9.6;9.7;7.9;8.8;8.9;SCH772984;9.8;9.9;sham-operated;vehicle;CLP-12h;CLP-6h;kidney;Control;cell_line;LPS 4h;liver;LPS 24h;heart;lung;Raw 264.7 cells;LPS 1h;2.3;C57BL/6W;8.1;>9;8.2;9.1;8.3;9.2;9.3;8.4;7.6;8.5;9.4;no treatment

This is because mitochondria produce most of the energy required by the cell. Impaired energy production, use of energy stores and mitochondrial dysfunction are major features in metabolic diseases. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how mitochondrial dysfunction can cause, contribute to, or result in insulin resistance and metabolic diseases. Furthermore there is growing evidence from genetic and genome wide-association studies that genetic variation in mtDNA contributes to these common metabolic diseases (Wallace, 2005), however there has been essentially no in vivo functional validation for these findings. Therefore we generated a mouse model homozygous for a polymorphism in the Mrpp3 gene identified in the French Canadian population responsible for 22% of mitochondrial epitranscriptome variation, with likely consequences on metabolism. We investigated the in vivo effects of the polymorphism on mitochondrial function and metabolism in mice fed normal and high fat diet. We identify that the polymorphism reduces the efficiency of mitochondrial RNA processing and this is most pronounced in the pancreas that results in insulin resistance. The MRPP3 protein containing the Asn434Ser polymorphism associates specifically with the calcium antiporter LETM1 preventing effective release of calcium from mitochondria and consequently impairs insulin release from the pancreatic islet cells of these mice. Reduction in insulin secretion and enlarged pancreatic islet size results in lower circulating levels of insulin that causes insulin resistance and liver steatosis. Our findings reveal for the first time the link between mitochondrial gene regulation and insulin resistance via calcium signaling.		Mrpp3N434S;Pancreatic islet cells;Mrpp3WT

How these constitutive exposures at specific developmental stages impact the host immune system for the long term remains poorly understood. Here we show that maternally restricted, mild infections, can have a permanent and tissue-specific impact on the offspring immunity. This imprinting is associated with a selective increase of Th17 cells within the gut, but not other compartment, and results from enhanced tonic responses to the microbiota. Mechanistically, we found that IL-6 produced by the mother during infection can directly act on fetus intestinal epithelial cells, leading to long-term alteration in chromatin and transcriptomic profiles in intestinal epithelial cells. As such at the adult stage, offspring display enhanced protective responses to oral infections.

(3) Methods: We carried out single-cell RNA sequencing of lung endothelial cells isolated from an endothelial cell lineage tracing mouse model in control and SU5416/Hypoxia-induced PAH conditions. (4) Measurements and Main Results: Endothelial cell populations corresponding to the different lung vessel types could be identified in both control and PAH mice. Differential gene expression analysis revealed novel global and vessel-type specific responses in endothelial cells due to PAH. Global changes included the up-regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class II pathway, supporting a role for endothelial cells in the inflammatory response in PAH. We also identified a PAH response specific to the second capillary EC population, with the up-regulation of genes involved in cell localization and angiogenesis. Comparison with human genetics and transcriptomics data revealed the regulation of four genes with variants associated to PAH and five genes up-regulated in endothelial cells in both human and mouse scRNA-seq. Among them, Aqp1 and Adam15 genes represent promising new candidates to target endothelial dysfunction. Finally, we identified zonation-dependent changes across the arteriovenous axis in PAH using an in-silico cell ordering approach and showed the up-regulation of the Serine/threonine-protein kinase Sgk1 at the junction between the macro- and micro-vasculature. (5) Conclusions: This study uncovers the murine endothelial cell transcriptomics changes in PAH at a high resolution, revealing novel candidates relevant to PAH.		lung;A;Cont;B;experiment 1;experiment 2;pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)

To perform transcriptomic profiling on PDAC, we collected primary PDAC tissues from surgically resected PDAC patients at the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NY, USA). Morphogenesis of epithelial tissues relies on the precise developmental control of cell polarity and architecture. In the early Drosophila embryo, the primary epithelium forms during cellularisation, following a tightly controlled genetic programme where specific sets of genes are up-regulated. Some of them, for instance, control membrane invagination between the nuclei anchored at the apical surface of the syncytium. We used microarrays to detail transcritomic profiling of PDACs.

Pursuing this intriguing pattern, we show that arthritis recurrence is mediated by long-lived synovial resident memory T cells (TRM). In three murine models, CD8+ cells bearing TRM markers remain in previously inflamed joints during remission. These cells are bona fide TRM, exhibiting failure to migrate from joint to joint, preferential uptake of fatty acids, and long-term residency. Disease flares result from TRM activation by antigen, leading to CCL5-mediated recruitment of circulating effector cells. Correspondingly, TRM depletion ameliorates recurrence in a site-specific manner. Human rheumatoid arthritis joint tissues contain a comparable CD8+-predominant TRM population, most evident in late-stage leukocyte-poor synovium, exhibiting limited T cell receptor diversity and a pro-inflammatory transcriptomic signature. Together, these findings establish synovial TRM cells as a targetable mediator of disease chronicity in autoimmune arthritis.		sulfasalazine, prednisone;elbow;arthrodesis;synovial tissue;F;methotrexate;none;rheumatoid arthritis;wrist;M;knee;neg;total knee arthroplasty;RF+;methotrexate, prednisone;total elbow arthroplasty;prednisone

The RV306 immunogenicity trial that employed a similar prime boost RV144 vaccine regimen with additional late boosts provided us with a unique opportunity to test if the gene signature was associated with ADCP (Pitisuttithum et al., 2020). We generated transcriptome-wide gene expression data from peripheral blood two weeks after the RV144 vaccine regimen (prior to the additional boosts) and assessed for enrichment of the gene signature with the magnitude of ADCP measured at the same timepoint in 24 participants. The gene signature with 118 enriched genes was significantly associated with higher magnitude of ADCP (NES=3.0, P<0.001).

Here we investigate how mutations in either ribosomal protein large (RPL) or ribosomal protein small (RPS) subunit genes selectively affect erythroid progenitor development and clinical phenotypes in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare ribosomopathy with limited therapeutic options. Using single-cell assays of patient-derived bone marrow, we delineated two distinct cellular trajectories segregating with ribosomal protein genotypes: almost complete loss of erythroid specification were observed in RPS-DBA. In contrast, we observed relative preservation of qualitatively abnormal erythroid progenitors and precursors in RPL-DBA. Although both DBA genotypes exhibited a pro-inflammatory bone marrow milieu, RPS-DBA was characterized by erythroid differentiation arrest, whereas RPL-DBA was characterized by preserved GATA1 expression and activity. Compensatory stress erythropoiesis in RPL-DBA exhibited disordered differentiation underpinned by an altered glucocorticoid molecular signature, including reduced ZFP36L2 expression, leading to milder anemia and improved corticosteroid response. This integrative analysis approach identified distinct pathways of erythroid failure and defined genotype-phenotype correlations in DBA. These findings may help facilitate therapeutic target discovery.

GSE180298	2021.09.23	Homo sapiens	GPL18573	TRUE	FALSE	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Uncovering perturbations in human hematopoiesis associated with healthy aging and myeloid malignancies at single cell resolution	Early hematopoiesis is a continuous process in which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) gradually differentiate and are primed toward specific lineages. Aging and myeloid malignant transformation are characterized by changes in the composition and regulation of HSPCs. In this study, we evaluated HSPCs obtained from young and elderly healthy donors using single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the transcriptional and regulatory perturbations associated with healthy aging at single cell resolution. We then applied this knowledge to identify specific changes associated with the development of myeloid malignancies. Based on the transcriptional profile obtained, we identified changes in the proportions of progenitor compartments during aging, and differences in their functionality, as evidenced by gene set enrichment analysis. Trajectory inference revealed that altered gene expression dynamics accompanied cell differentiation, which could explain age-associated aberrant hematopoiesis. Next, we focused on key regulators of transcription by constructing gene regulatory networks and detected regulons that were specifically active in elderly individuals. Using the previous findings as a reference, we analyzed scRNA-seq data obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia and detected an alteration of the expression dynamics of genes involved in erythroid differentiation and identified specific transcription factors deregulated in acute myeloid leukemia. We demonstrate that the combination of single cell technologies and computational tools enables the study of a variety of cellular mechanisms involved in early hematopoiesis and can be used to dissect perturbed differentiation trajectories associated with aging and malignant transformation. Furthermore, the identification of abnormal regulatory mechanisms associated with myeloid malignancies could be exploited for personalized therapeutic approaches in individual patients.

We demonstrate here that PKCl/i inactivation results in the hyper-stimulation of the IFN cascade and the enhanced recruitment of CD8+ T cells that impaired the growth of intestinal tumors. PKCl/i directly phosphorylates and represses the activity of ULK2, promoting its degradation through an endosomal microautophagy-driven ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. Loss of PKCl/i results in increased levels of enzymatically active ULK2 that by direct phosphorylation activates TBK1 to foster the activation of the STING-mediated IFN response. PKCl/i inactivation also triggers autophagy that prevents STING degradation by chaperone-mediated autophagy. Thus, PKCl/i is a hub regulating the IFN pathway and three autophagic mechanisms that serve to maintain its homeostatic control. Importantly, single cell multiplex imaging and bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that low PKCl/i levels correlate with enhanced IFN signaling and good prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.		sgPrkci;small intestine;sgScbr;Mouse tumor organoids from Liver metastasis of intestinal tumor;C57BL/6

In particular, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an established contributor to multiple sclerosis, lupus, and other disorders. Previously, we demonstrated that the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) transactivating protein occupies up to half of the risk loci for a set of seven autoimmune disorders. To further examine the mechanistic roles played by EBNA2 at these loci on a genome-wide scale, we globally examined gene expression, chromatin accessibility, chromatin looping, and EBNA2 binding, in a B cell line that was 1) uninfected, 2) infected with a strain of EBV lacking EBNA2, or 3) infected with a strain that expresses EBNA2. We identified >400 EBNA2-dependent differentially expressed human genes and >5,000 EBNA2 binding events in the human genome. ATAC-seq analysis revealed >2,000 regions in the human genome with EBNA2-dependent chromatin accessibility, and HiChIP-seq data revealed >1,700 regions where EBNA2 altered chromatin looping interactions. Importantly, autoimmune genetic risk loci were highly enriched at the sites of these EBNA2-dependent chromatin-altering events. We present examples of autoimmune risk genotype-dependent EBNA2 events, nominating genetic risk mechanisms for autoimmune risk loci such as ZMIZ1. Taken together, our results reveal important interactions between host genetic variation and EBNA2-driven disease mechanisms. Further, our study highlights a critical role for EBNA2 in rewiring human gene regulatory programs through rearrangement of the chromatin landscape and nominates these interactions as components of genetic mechanisms that influence the risk of multiple autoimmune diseases.

GSE175480	2021.09.23	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Vemurafenib acts as molecular switch in Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis	Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a neoplasm marked by the accumulation of CD1a+CD207+ cells. It is most commonly driven by a somatic activating mutation in the BRAF kinase (BRAFV600E). Multisystem disease with risk-organ involvement requires intensive chemotherapy, making BRAF-inhibitors an attractive option. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the course of an LCH patient treated with the combination of vemurafenib with salvage chemotherapy who achieved complete clinical and molecular remission. We conclusively show that there is no relationship between blood-BRAF levels and clinical presentation during treatment with vemurafenib, but that vemurafenib leads to a fast, efficient, but reversible inhibition of clinical manifestations of high-risk LCH such as cytopenia, fever, and hypoproteinemia. In line, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines exactly mirror vemurafenib administration. Genotyping for the BRAFV600E mutation shows its presence in multiple hematopoietic cell types, including NK cells and granulocytes. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells at time of diagnosis and during treatment indicate that RAF-inhibition abrogates the expression of inflammatory cytokines previously implicated in LCH. Together, our data suggest that while the CD1a+CD207+ histiocytes are the hallmark of LCH, other BRAF-mutated cells themselves contribute significantly to morbidity in patients with multisystem LCH.

Of the approximately ~71 million individuals chronically infected with HCV, 10-20% are expected to develop severe liver complications in their lifetime. Epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation and histone modifications become profoundly disrupted in disease processes including liver disease. Methods: To understand how HCV infection influences the epigenome and whether these events remain as ‘scars’ following cure of chronic HCV infection, we mapped genome-wide DNA methylation, four key regulatory histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) and open chromatin by ATAC-seq in parental and HCV-infected immortalized hepatocytes and the Huh7.5 HCC cell line, along with DNA methylation and gene expression analyses following elimination of HCV in these models through treatment with interferon-α or a direct-acting antiviral (DAA). Results: Our data demonstrate that HCV infection profoundly impacts the epigenome (particularly enhancers), HCV shares epigenetic targets with interferon-α targets, an overwhelming majority of epigenetic changes induced by HCV remain as ‘scars’ on the epigenome following cured infection, and similar findings are observed in primary human patient samples cured of chronic HCV infection. Supplementation of interferon-α/DAA antiviral regimens with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine synergizes in reverting aberrant DNA methylation changes induced by HCV. Finally, both HCV-infected and cured cells displayed a blunted immune response, demonstrating a functional effect of epigenetic scarring. Conclusions: Integration of epigenetic and transcriptional data elucidates key gene deregulation events driven by HCV infection and how this may underpin the long-term elevated risk for HCC in patients cured of HCV due to epigenome scarring.

Methylated Cytosine (5mC) can be oxidized by the TET family of enzymes to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), a key intermediate in the de-methylation cycle, and 5-hmC levels are reduced in malignancies such as AML and melanoma. We constructed a tissue microarray of human cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) tumors and found a global reduction in 5-hmC levels compared to adjacent skin. Using a murine K14-CreER system, we have found that loss of Tet2 promotes carcinogen-induced SCC, and cooperates with loss of Tp53 in to drive spontaneous SCC tumors in epithelial tissues. Loss of Tet2 in the normal epidermis leads to site-specific changes in 5-hmC levels, with many genes showing both increased and decreased levels of 5-hmC. Importantly, many of these changes were in genes regulating keratinocyte differentiation and self-renewal, consistent with reported roles for Tet enzymes in controlling lineage commitment in hematopoietic stem cells and ES cells. These results establish a functional role for Tet2 in the regulation of 5-hmC in the epidermis and demonstrate that Tet2 is a bone fide tumor suppressor in SCC.

A recent series of magnetic resonance imaging studies have demonstrated that, in Wolfram syndrome, neurodegenerative processes appear during childhood and adolescence on top of a clinically silent global defect in brain development. Here, differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from Wolfram syndrome patients’ cells along the neural lineage has revealed phenotypic and molecular correlates of that global brain defect. A proportion of neural cells displayed aberrant neurite outgrowth associated with alterations in the expression of genes involved in axonal guidance. In contrast, an activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress response genes was absent while it is present in late Wolfram syndrome degenerative processes. These results concur to the broader hypothesis that axon guidance genes may play a role in the susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases.

U2AF1 mutations that code for the most common amino acid substitutions are always heterozygous, and the retained wild-type allele is expressed, suggesting that mutant hematopoietic cells may require the residual wild-type allele to be viable and cause disease. We show that hematopoiesis and RNA splicing in U2af1 heterozygous knock-out mice was similar to control mice, but that deletion of the wild-type allele in U2AF1 (S34F) heterozygous mutant expressing hematopoietic cells (i.e., hemizygous mutant) was lethal. These results confirm that U2AF1 mutant hematopoietic cells are dependent on the expression of wild-type U2AF1 for survival in vivo and that U2AF1 is a haplo-essential cancer gene. Mutant U2AF1 (S34F) expressing cells were also more sensitive to reduced, but not absent, expression of wild-type U2AF1 than non-mutant cells. Furthermore, mice transplanted with leukemia cells expressing mutant U2AF1 had significantly reduced tumor burden and improved survival after the wild-type U2af1 allele was deleted compared to when it was not deleted. These results suggest that selectively targeting the wild-type U2AF1 allele in heterozygous mutant cells could induce cancer cell death and be a therapeutic strategy for patients harboring U2AF1 mutations.		untreated;1250 ppm Doxycycline and pIpC;E14.5 fetal liver hematopoietic progenitor cells (Lin- cKit+ Sca1-);Vav1-Cre/U2af1(flox/flox);adult bone marrow hematopoietic cells (Lin- cKit+ Sca1-);fetal liver;hematopoietic progenitor cells (Lin- cKit+ Sca1-);Vav1-Cre;U2af1(flox/flox);E14.5;Mx1-Cre/rTA/tgU2AF1(WT)/U2af1(flox/S34F);bone marrow;Vav1-Cre/U2af1(wt/S34F);10,000 ppm Doxycycline and pIpC;2500 ppm Doxycycline and pIpC;Mx1-Cre/rTA/tgU2AF1(WT)/U2af1(wt/wt);hematopoietic cells (Lin- cKit+ Sca1-);Vav1-Cre/U2af1(wt/flox);adult

We find that G34 mutations distinctly impede H3K36 methylation by SETD2. Consequently, the reduction of H3K36 methylation leads to high levels of PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 on G34 mutant nucleosomes. We find that H3.3G34W expression in murine mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) promotes aberrant gain of H3K27me2/3 and loss of H3K27ac at active enhancers containing SETD2. mMSCs expressing H3.3G34W display a unique transcriptional program that is dependent on PRC2 activity *in cis* and exhibit enhanced tumor development *in vivo*. Altogether, we demonstrate that H3.3G34 oncohistones selectively promote PRC2 activity by interfering with SETD2-mediated H3K36 methylation. We propose that PRC2-mediated silencing of enhancers involved in cell differentiation represents a potential mechanism that drives these malignancies.		cells overexpressing H3.1WT;cells overexpressing H3.3G34W;C3H10T1/2;cells overexpressing H3.3G34W;K36R;cells overexpressing H3.3G34R;cells overexpressing H3.1G34W;cells overexpressing H3.3WT;cells overexpressing H3.3G34W;K27R;cells overexpressing H3.3K27R

Gene induction typically involves cis regulatory elements that contact and activate genes on the same chromosome. Here we show that ecDNA hubs, clusters of ~10-100 ecDNAs within the nucleus, enable intermolecular enhancer-gene interactions to promote oncogene overexpression in trans. ecDNAs encoding multiple distinct oncogenes form hubs in diverse cancer cell types and primary tumors. Each ecDNA is more likely to transcribe the oncogene when spatially clustered with additional ecDNAs. ecDNA hubs are tethered by the BET protein BRD4 in a MYC-amplified colorectal cancer cell line. BET inhibitor JQ1 disperses ecDNA hubs and preferentially inhibits ecDNA-based oncogene transcription. A BRD4-bound promoter in PVT1 is ectopically fused to MYC and duplicated in ecDNA, receiving promiscuous enhancer input to drive potent MYC expression. PVT1 promoter on a heterologous episome suffices to mediate gene activation in trans by ecDNA hubs in a JQ1-sensitive manner. Systematic CRISPRi silencing of ecDNA enhancers reveal intermolecular enhancer-gene activation among multiple oncogene loci amplified on distinct ecDNAs. Together, these results demonstrate that ecDNA hubs are protein-tethered clusters of ecDNAs which enable intermolecular transcriptional regulation. ecDNA hubs may act as units of oncogene function, cooperative evolution, and potential targets for cancer therapy.

Pre- and post-operative physical functioning were assessed by forelimb grip strength and motor coordination on the accelerating rotarod. RNA sequencing of soleus muscles collected on post-operative day 5 (POD 5) showed that laparotomy induced age-associated differential gene expression and canonical pathway activation with the greatest effects in the youngest mice. The 24-month-old mice were stratified into low functioning (LF) and high functioning (HF) groups based on their baseline motor performance on the accelerating rotarod. RNA-sequencing showed 224 and 228 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for HF and LF, respectively, compared to their respective controls. Only 21 DEGs were observed in both groups. We conclude that pre-operative performance on the accelerating rotarod correlates with differences in skeletal muscle gene expression, which may contribute to the differences in functional outcomes post-operatively in HF and LF mice. These findings demonstrate a mouse model of laparotomy which recapitulated some features of post-operative skeletal muscle decline in older adults following surgery, and identified age-associated, laparotomy-induced molecular signatures in skeletal muscles.

Dysregulation of mammary stem cells is a key mechanism for cancer development. However, stem cell characterization is challenging because reporter models using cell-specific promoters do not fully recapitulate the mammary stem cell populations. We previously found that a 270-basepair Runx1 enhancer element, named eR1, marked stem cells in the blood and stomach. Here, we identified eR1 activity in a rare subpopulation of the ERα-negative luminal epithelium in mouse mammary glands. Lineage-tracing using an eR1-CreERT2 mouse model revealed that eR1+ luminal cells generated the entire luminal lineage and milk-secreting alveoli – eR1 therefore specifically marks lineage-restricted luminal stem cells. eR1-targeted-conditional knockout of Runx1 led to the expansion of luminal epithelial cells, accompanied by elevated ERα expression. Our findings demonstrate a definitive role for Runx1 in the regulation of the eR1-positive luminal stem cell proliferation during mammary homeostasis. Our findings identify a mechanistic link for Runx1 in stem cell proliferation and its dysregulation in breast cancer. Runx1 inactivation is therefore likely to be an early hit in the cell-of-origin of ERα+ luminal type breast cancer.

Uncovering how dramatic changes to the transcriptional program contribute to TC-NER (transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair) comprises one of the most fascinating frontiers in DNA repair research. Here we examined UV-induced gene regulation in human fibroblasts by performing RNA-seq with fractionated chromatin-associated and cytoplasmic transcripts. This approach allowed us to separate the synthesis of nascent transcripts from the accumulation of mature RNAs. In addition to documenting the subcellular locations of coding transcripts, our results also provide a high-resolution view of the transcription activities of noncoding RNAs in response to cellular stress. At the same time, the data showed that vast majority of chromatin-enriched DNA damage response transcripts are cis-acting. Distinct from coding genes that transcripts with shorter length are prefered to be recovered first, repression of lncRNA transcription after UV exposure is inactivated first on noncoding transcripts with longer length. This work provides an updated framework for cellular RNA organization in response to stress and may prove useful in understanding how cells respond to transcription-blocking DNA damage.		untreated;skin fibroblast cells derived from Cockayne syndrome patient;treated with 10 J/m2 UV-C irradiation and recovered for 24 hours;MRC5-VA;treated with 10 J/m2 UV-C irradiation and recovered for 30 minutes;CS1AN;Skin fibroblast cells;Lung fibroblast cells;normal lung tissue-derived fibroblast cells;treated with 10 J/m2 UV-C irradiation and recovered for 3 hours

The androgen receptor (AR) antagonist enzalutamide is a FDA-approved drug for treatment of patients with late-stage prostate cancer and is currently under clinical study for early-stage prostate cancer treatment. After a short positive response period to enzalutamide, tumors will develop drug resistance. In this study, we uncovered that DNA methylation was deregulated in enzalutamide-resistant cells. DNMT activity and DNMT3B expression were upregulated in resistant cell lines. Enzalutamide induced the expression of DNMT3A and DNMT3B in prostate cancer cells with a potential role of p53 and pRB in this process. The overexpression of DNMT3B3, a DNMT3B variant, promoted an enzalutamide-resistant phenotype in C4-2B cell lines. Inhibition of DNA methylation and DNMT3B knockdown induced a re-sensitization to enzalutamide. Decitabine treatment in enzalutamide-resistant cells induced a decrease of the expression of AR-V7 and changes of genes for apoptosis, DNA repair and mRNA splicing. Combination treatment of Decitabine and enzalutamide induced a decrease of tumor weight, Ki-67 and AR-V7 expression and an increase of cleaved-caspase3 levels in 22Rv1 xenografts. The collective results suggest that DNA methylation pathway is deregulated after enzalutamide resistance onset and that targeting DNA methyltransferases restores the sensitivity to enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells.

Here, we further our studies on Transmembrane protein 135 (Tmem135), a gene involved in retinal aging, by examining the transcriptomic profiles of wildtype, heterozygous and homozygous Tmem135 mutant posterior eyecup samples through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We found significant gene expression changes in both heterozygous and homozygous Tmem135 mutant mouse eyecups that correlates with visual function deficits. Further analysis revealed many genes involved in lipid metabolism are changed due to the Tmem135 mutation. We confirm these changes by finding increased lipid accumulation in mutant Tmem135 eyecup samples. Since mutant Tmem135 mice have similar ocular pathologies as human age-related macular degeneration (AMD) eyes, we compared our homozygous Tmem135 mutant eyecup RNA-Seq dataset with datasets of human AMD donor eyes. We find similar changes in genes involved in lipid metabolism between the homozygous Tmem135 mutant eyecups and AMD donor eyes. Our study suggests that the Tmem135 mutation affects lipid metabolism as similarly observed in human AMD eyes, thus Tmem135 mutant mice can serve as a good model for the role of dysregulated lipid metabolism in AMD.

To experimentally address this concept, we generated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific knockout mice that lack both executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7 (Casp3/7?IEC), which are the converging point of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Surprisingly, the overall architecture, cellular landscape and proliferation rate remained unchanged in these mice. However, non-apoptotic cell extrusion was increased in Casp3/7?IEC mice, compensating apoptosis deficiency, maintaining the same physiological level of IEC shedding. Microbiome richness and composition stayed unaffected, bearing no sign of dysbiosis. Transcriptome and single cell RNA sequences analyses of IECs and immune cells revealed no differences in signaling pathways of differentiation and inflammation. These findings demonstrate that during homeostasis apoptosis per se is dispensable for IEC turnover at the top of intestinal villi intestinal tissue dynamics, microbiome composition and immune regulation.

Hybrid NEPC-adenocarcinoma (AdCa) tumors are common, often eluding accurate pathologic diagnosis and requiring ancillary markers for classification. We recently performed an outlier-based meta-analysis across a number of independent gene expression microarray datasets to identify novel markers that differentiate NEPC from AdCa, including up-regulation of Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) and loss of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). Here, using diverse cancer gene expression datasets, we show that Hippo pathway-related genes, including YAP1, are among the top down-regulated gene sets with expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factors, including INSM1. In prostate cancer cell lines, transgenic mouse models and human prostate tumor cohorts, we confirm that YAP1 RNA and YAP1 protein expression are silenced in NEPC and demonstrate that the inverse correlation of INSM1 and YAP1 expression helps to distinguish AdCa from NEPC. Mechanistically, we find that YAP1 loss in NEPC may help to maintain INSM1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and we further demonstrate that YAP1 silencing likely occurs epigenetically, via CpG hypermethylation near its transcriptional start site. Taken together, these data nominate two additional markers to distinguish NEPC from AdCa and add to data from other tumor types suggesting that Hippo signaling is tightly reciprocally regulated with neuroendocrine transcription factor expression.

Epigenetic changes underlie the establishment of trained innate immunity therefore host metabolism and this response are intimately linked. However, little is known regarding the influence of lipids on the development and function of trained immunity. Utilizing two models of pulmonary bacterial infection combined with multi-omic approaches, we identified persistent, pathogen-specific changes to the lung lipidome that correlated with differences in the trained immune response. Further, we establish the specific cellular populations in the lung that contribute to this altered lipidome. Together these results expand our understanding of the pulmonary trained innate immune response and the contributions of host lipids in informing that response.		whole lung;whole lung tissue;F. tularensis live vaccine strain;None;B. pertussis

ARID1B and its paralog ARID1A encode for mutually exclusive subunits of the BAF chromatin remodeler, yet their role in cell-fate determination is poorly understood. We discovered a novel neural crest configuration of the BAF complex (ARID1B-BAF), which includes ARID1B, SMARCA4, and eight additional subunits. The ARID1B-BAF regulates lineage commitment upon differentiation cues through attenuation of pluripotency enhancers of the SOX2 network. Consistently, the ARID1B-BAF interacts with SALL4, which is known to have repressing abilities during lineage commitment. In iPSCs, pluripotency enhancers are maintained in active state by cooperation between the pioneer activity of SOX2 and the ARID1A-containing BAF. At the onset of differentiation, ARID1B-BAF replaces ARID1A-BAF at these enhancers, eliciting chromatin repression and coordinating the exit from pluripotency. Coffin-Siris patient cells fail to perform the ARID1A/ARID1B switch, and maintain ARID1A-BAF at the pluripotency enhancers throughout CNCC differentiation. This correlates with aberrant SOX2 binding at the pluripotency enhancers, and failure to reposition SOX2 at the developmental enhancers. SOX2 dysregulation promotes upregulation of the NANOG regulatory network, impairing CNCC differentiation. Intriguingly, the patient with the most extreme molecular phenotype is also affected by a more severe version of the syndrome. These findings have significant biomedical implications, since they suggest a direct connection between ARID1B mutations and developmental disorders.

Lung endothelial subsets, capillaries (capEC) and post capillary venules (PCV), are known to play a pivotal role in maintaining normal homeostasis. The aim of the study is to reveal transcriptional changes in lung endothelial subsets during sepsis. Methods: Sepsis was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Lung tissues were collected 4 hour after induction of sepsis. Single cell suspension was prepared by enzymatic digestion. Blood endothelial cells (BECs) were enriched by depletion of hematolymphoid cells and epithelial cells by using anti-CD45 and CD326 microbeads. CapEC and PCV were sorted from enriched BECs using fluorescent-labeled antibodies. capEC subset was identified as CD31+Icam1+Vcam1- and PCV subset was identified as CD31+Icam1+Vcam1+. EC subsets were directly sorted into RLT buffer. Total RNA was isolated from the sorted cells with RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen) and the quality of RNA was checked by Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 pico assay. Sequence library was prepared using SMARTer® Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2-Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Bio USA, Inc.). After library preparation and quality check, the double-stranded-cDNA was sequenced on NextSeq 500 (Illumina) using (read one-index reads-read two, bp): 75-8-8-75 setup. Differentially expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 in R program. Results: Differential expression analysis revealed that lung capEC is transcriptionally different than PCV. capEC and PCV responded differently after induction of sepsis. Enrichment analysis revealed that capEC are more enriched with genes related to regulation of coagulation, vascular permeability, wound healing and lipid metabolic process. On the other hand, PCV are more enriched with genes related to cell chemotaxis, cell-cell adhesion by integrins, chemokine biosynthesis process, regulation of actin filament process, neutrophil homeostasis.		capillaries (capEc);8-10 week;WT type;Lung;4h after CLP surgery;Lung endothelial cells;4h after sham surgery;post capillary venules (PCV);C57BL/6;male

We verified that tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein-8 like-2 (TIPE2) works as a potent negative regulator in NK cell maturation. We found that TIPE2 expression gradually increased during NK cell ontogenesis correlating to their maturation stages in mice. NK-specific TIPE2 deficiency resulted in increased number of mature NK cells. To further confirm the role of TIPE2 in NK cell maturation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing. Based on the key gene expression of NK cell effector molecules, transcriptional factors, maturation markers, and proliferation marker, we identified NK cell maturation program as Cluster#1->Cluster#2->Cluster#0 by which immature NK cells should go through to gain optimal effector functions at the cost of proliferation ability. According to this model, NK-specific TIPE2 deficient mice contained more NK cells belonging to the terminally mature Cluster#0 than control mice (up to 10% more), which is consistent with what we observed by flow cytometry. Therefore, these results collectively showed that NK-specific TIPE2 deficiency promotes NK cell maturation.		Spleen;Tnfaip8l2 flox/flox; NKp46iCre+;post natal week 6;NKp46iCre+;C57BL/6

They function by targeting eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A, an RNA helicase critical for recruitment of the 40S ribosome (and associated factors) to mRNA templates. To appreciate how rocaglates could best be enabled in the clinic, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important, as this could inform on strategies to bypass such events as well as responsive tumor types. In performing a forward genetics screen using a cDNA library, we identified FOXP3 to be a gene of interest. As FOXP3 is a known transcriptional regulator, understandings its impacts on the transcriptional landscape was a logical undertaking in elucidating the resistance mechanis. Here, we report on the RNAseq results in Hap1 cells overexpressing FOXP3 compared to a negative control cell line expressing GFP.

We report the gene signature of COVID-19 over the course of the disease in both age groups. The kinetic of infection was divided in 5-time intervals according to the calculated days POS: interval 1 (0-5), interval 2 (6-14), interval 3 (15-22), interval 4 (23-35), and interval 5 (36-81). Methods: RNA extraction was performed automatically via the PAXgene Blood miRNA Kit and the QIAcube instrument (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration and quality were assessed by using the Qubit instrument (Invitrogen) and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, respectively. The Stranded Total RNA Ribo-Zero Plus kit from Illumina was used for the library preparation with 100 ng of total RNA as input. Library molarity and quality were assessed with the Qubit and Tapestation using a DNA High sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were pooled at 2 nM for clustering and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer for a minimum of 30 million single-end 100 reads per sample. Main results: (I) we observed an antiviral-IFN-signature and innate-cell-activation within the first 5 days post symptoms onset (POS), while genes associated with CD4 T-cell responses, plasma cells and immunoglobulin were upregulated in both age groups during the first two weeks POS, indicative of SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune responses; (II) in adults, genes associated with IFN antiviral responses and activated dendritic cells were maintained during the second week of disease, and subsided only after 14 days.

A better understanding of circRNA biological function in high-grade glioma might contribute to the therapeutic efficacy. Here, a circRNA merely up-regulated in high-grade glioma, circGLIS3 (hsa_circ_0002874, originating from exon 2 of GLIS3), was validated by microarray and qRT-PCR. Functional experiments uncovered that up-regulation of circGLIS3 promoted glioma cell migration and invasion, and showed aggressive characteristics in tumor-bearing mice. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical staining showed that circGLIS3 could promoted Ezrin T567 phosphorylation. Further investigation showed that circGLIS3 could be excreted by glioma through exosomes and induced endothelial cells angiogenesis. This study indicates that circGLIS3 is up-regulated in high-grade glioma and contributes to the invasion and angiogenesis of glioma via promoting Ezrin T567 phosphorylation.		glioma cell line;transfected with sh-circGLIS3-1 lentivirus;transfected with sh-circGLIS3-2 lentivirus;transfected with sh-NC lentivirus;brain;U251 cell line

While most are inert, a subset is capable of influencing the activity of the host genes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying how such elements affect the epigenome and transcriptome and their roles in driving intra-specific variation remain unclear. Here, utilizing wildtype murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) derived from distinct genetic backgrounds, we discovered a polymorphic MMERGLN element capable of regulating H3K27ac enrichment, transcription and higher-order chromatin structure of neighboring loci. We demonstrated that this polymorphic element enhanced the neighboring Klhdc4 gene’s expression in cis, which in turn altered activity of downstream stress response genes. The results suggest that the polymorphic ERV-derived cis-regulatory element contribute to strain-specific phenotypes from particular stimuli. Moreover, we identified thousands of potential polymorphic ERVs in mESCs from both strains and illustrated their potential to regulate nearby histone modifications and transcription. Overall, our findings show the mechanism of how polymorphic ERVs can shape the epigenome and transcriptional networks that give rise to phenotypic divergence between individuals.

Based on data demonstrating that ~50% of club cells express MUC5B, a secretory mucin critical for mucociliary clearance, we hypothesized that subpopulations of club cells with distinct functions may exist. To evaluate this, the SAE of normal nonsmokers and healthy cigarette smokers was sampled by bronchoscopy and brushing followed by single cell sequencing using Drop-seq technology. Subpopulations of SCGCB1A1+KRT5loMUC5AC- club cells were assessed by unsupervised clustering to evaluate club cell subpopulations. Immunostaining of SAE in lung sections, brushed SAE cells, and in vitro air-liquid interface culture was utilized to confirm the transcriptomic-based observations. Unsupervised clustering of SCGCB1A1+KRT5loMUC5AC‾ club cells in the SAE identified 3 unique club cell populations that differed by differentiation state and function, including: (1) progenitor; (2) proliferating; and (3) effector subpopulations. The progenitor club cell population was energetically active with high expression of mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins and the highest KRT5 levels vs other club cell populations. The proliferating population, defined by high expression of cyclins and proliferation markers, was the smallest, representing 2% of club cells. The effector club cell cluster expressed transcripts for host defense genes, xenobiotic metabo-lism, and barrier functions commonly associated with club cell function. Comparison of the club cell subpopulations in smokers vs nonsmokers demonstrated that the proportion of the club cell effector population was significantly decreased in smokers with a concomitant significant in-crease in the proliferating cell population. These observations provide novel insights into both the makeup of human SAE club cell subpopulations and smoking-induced changes in club cell biology.

To date, a comprehensive roadmap at single-cell resolution for hPSC-derived hematopoietic differentiation has not been established. Here, we performed extensive single-cell transcriptomic analyses to map fate choices and gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs and identified strategies to improve the quantity and quality of hPSC-derived hematopoietic cells. By focusing specifically on cell populations and molecular events involved in endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT), the EHT was identified accompanying by a decline in aerobic metabolism and providing hypoxia in vitro enhances arterial and hematopoietic differentiation. Furthermore, arterial endothelial cells are validated as a critical regulator of definitive hematopoietic progenitor specification.

The germinal centre (GC) is a hallmark of adaptive immunity. Gene expression in GCs is tightly regulated but the impact of post-transcriptional mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we show that expression of the RNA binding protein HuR is essential in GCs. In its absence, GC B cells are at a competitive disadvantage and high-affinity antibody production is severely impaired. Mechanistically, HuR affects the transcriptome qualitatively and quantitatively to enable the expression of a Myc- dependent transcriptional program essential for light zone B cells to re-enter into the dark zone for further proliferation and Ig somatic hypermutation. HuR controls the splicing and abundance of mRNAs required for entry into and transition through the S phase of the cell cycle. HuR modulates a gene signature associated with DNA deamination preserving GC B cells from extensive DNA damage and cell death.		primary germinal centre B cells;dark zone (DZ, CD19+ IgD- CD38- CD95+ CXCR4+ CD86- cells);AAACATCG;CGAACTTA;DZ GC B cells;GAGTTAGC;ACCACTGT;GATAGACA;light zone (LZ, CD19+ IgD- CD38- CD95+ CXCR4- CD86+ cells);C57BL/6;GAGCTGAA;HuRfl/fl AIDCre (HuR KO);GACAGTGC;AGCAGGAA;AAGGACAC;ATCATTCC;CTGGCATA;LZ GC B cells;GCCACATA;HuRfl/fl (control WT)

The gene encoding its ligand, XCL1, is expressed constitutively by innate lymphoid cells such as natural killer (NK) cells. The evolutionary conservation of XCR1, XCL1 in vertebrates suggests that they play a critical, yet uncharacterized, role in immune responses. Here we showed using mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, that the XCL1/XCR1 axis promoted the intra-splenic repositioning of cDC1 towards IFN--producing NK cells forming superclusters around infected cells. There, cDC1 and NK cells engaged into physical interactions enhancing their respective production of IL-12 and IFN-. This feed-forward mechanism also led to NK cell production of GM-CSF, which upregulated CCR7 on cDC1, instructing them to migrate into the T cell area for the priming of CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, we identified a novel mechanism through which NK cells boost the relay between innate and adaptive immunities by regulating the spatiotemporal functions of cDC1.

A study of migration and invasion in in vivo and in vitro epithelial systems	Metastasis is the leading cause of death for cancer patients. Consequently it is imperative that we improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie progression of tumour growth towards malignancy. A large-scale genetic screen was carried out to identify genes that affect tumour progression in the living fly. This screen identified CG7379 as promoting cancer cell invasion when gene expression was knocked down in epithelial tumours in the dorsal thorax of the fly. The uncharacterised CG7379 Drosophila gene shows high homology with the human ING (inhibitor of growth) gene family. ING proteins are known to be involved in the control of cell proliferation, senescence and apoptosis. However, their potential role in cell migration and invasion is yet to be properly documented. Homeostasis of epithelial tissues relies on the control of cell polarity and architecture, and our results strongly suggest that CG7379 and ING1 play an important role in cell-cell junction integrity maintenance. The knockdown of both the Drosophila and human gene increases invasion in the living animal and in in vitro invasion assays respectively and gene knock-down led to severe disruption of cell-cell junction integrity. We used Clariom™ S Assay arrays to detail the global programme of gene expression following ING1 KD to detect DEG involved in regulation of cell motility and cell-cell junction assembly and maintenance.

Ependymal precursors require GemC1/Mcidas expression to massively amplify centrioles and become multiciliated cells. Here we show that GemC1-dependent differentiation occurs mostly in cycling Radial Glial Cells, in which a DNA damage response, including replicative stress and dysfunctional telomeres, arrests the cell cycle after the G1/S restriction point due to the activation of the p53-p21 pathway, which contributes to centriole amplification.

Here, our aim was to identify the effector mechanisms controlling the early stages of intranasal infection with Brucella in C57BL/6 mice. During the first 48 hours of infection, alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the main cells infected in the lungs. Using RNA sequencing, we identified the aconitate decarboxylase 1 gene (Acod1; also known as Immune responsive gene 1), as one of the genes most upregulated in murine AMs in response to B. melitensis infection at 24 hours post-infection. Upregulation of Acod1 was confirmed by RT-qPCR in lungs infected with B. melitensis and B. abortus. We observed that Acod1-/- C57BL/6 mice display a higher bacterial load in their lungs than wild-type (wt) mice following B. melitensis or B. abortus infection, demonstrating that Acod1 participates in the control of pulmonary Brucella infection. The ACOD1 enzyme is mostly produced in mitochondria of macrophages, and converts cis-aconitate, a metabolite in the Krebs cycle, into itaconate. Dimethyl itaconate (DMI), a chemically-modified membrane permeable form of itaconate, has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on Brucella growth in vitro. Interestingly, modelling studies suggest the binding of itaconate into the binding site of isocitrate lyase. DMI does not inhibit multiplication of the isocitrate lyase deletion mutant ∆aceA B. abortus in vitro. Finally, we observed that, unlike the wt strain, the ∆aceA B. abortus strain multiplies similarly in wt and Acod1-/- C57BL/6 mice. These data suggest that bacterial isocitrate lyase might be a target of itaconate in AMs.		lung;Lung;intranasally infected with Brucella melitensis;wild type;C57BL/6;naive mice

Often, two distinct compartments of tumor microenvironment, the effusion and disseminated pleural tumors, co-exist in the pleural cavity, presenting a major challenge for therapeutic interventions and drug delivery. Clinical evidence suggests that MPE comprises abundant tumor associated myeloid cells with the tumor-promoting phenotype, impairing antitumor immunity. Here, we developed liposomal cyclic dinucleotide (LNP-CDN) for targeted activation of STING signaling in macrophages and dendritic cells and showed that, upon intrapleural administration, they induce drastic changes in the transcriptional landscape in MPE, mitigating the immune cold MPE in both the effusion and pleural tumors. Moreover, combination immunotherapy with blockade of PD-L1 potently reduced MPE volume and inhibited tumor growth not only in pleural cavity but also in lung parenchyma, conferring significantly prolonged survival of MPE-bearing mice. Furthermore, the LNP-CDN-induced immunological effects were also observed with clinical MPE samples, suggesting the potential of intrapleural LNP-CDN for clinical MPE immunotherapy.

Often, two distinct compartments of tumor microenvironment, the effusion and disseminated pleural tumors, co-exist in the pleural cavity, presenting a major challenge for therapeutic interventions and drug delivery. Clinical evidence suggests that MPE comprises abundant tumor associated myeloid cells with the tumor-promoting phenotype, impairing antitumor immunity. Here, we developed liposomal cyclic dinucleotide (LNP-CDN) for targeted activation of STING signaling in macrophages and dendritic cells and showed that, upon intrapleural administration, they induce drastic changes in the transcriptional landscape in MPE, mitigating the immune cold MPE in both the effusion and pleural tumors. Moreover, combination immunotherapy with blockade of PD-L1 potently reduced MPE volume and inhibited tumor growth not only in pleural cavity but also in lung parenchyma, conferring significantly prolonged survival of MPE-bearing mice. Furthermore, the LNP-CDN-induced immunological effects were also observed with clinical MPE samples, suggesting the potential of intrapleural LNP-CDN for clinical MPE immunotherapy.

Various GPCRs are upregulated in activated CD4 T cells, among them P2Y10, a putative lysophospholipid receptor that is officially still considered an orphan GPCR. P2Y10-deficient CD4 T cells showed normal activation, differentiation, and proliferation, but reduced chemokine-induced migration and polarization. Chemokine-induced activation of RhoA, a central regulator of polarization and migration, was reduced in the absence of P2Y10, and this was due to loss of an autocrine feedback loop involving chemokine-triggered release of lysophosphatidylserine and adenosine triphosphate and consecutive P2Y10-dependent RhoA activation. In line with impaired chemokine-induced T cell migration, we found that mice with CD4 T cell-specific P2Y10 deficiency showed reduced T cell infiltration into the spinal cord in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis		spleen, lymph node;MACS-sorted CD4 T cells from peripheral lymph nodes and spleen;CD4 T cell;CD4 T cell-specific P2Y10 knockout;control;C57BL6

However, it is unclear if epigenome changes, in particular cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation, is a consequence or cause of changes observed in higher order genome architecture. Here, we compare replication timing profiles and three dimensional (3D) genome organisation, using Hi-C and single cell Repli-Seq in the DNMT1 and DNMT3B DNA methyltransferases double knockout hypomethylated DKO1 colorectal cancer cell line and its parental HCT116 cell line. We find that the hypomethylated cells show a profound loss of replication timing precision, gain of single cell replication timing heterogeneity and loss of chromatin conformation integrity. Discrete regions, that undergo a large change in replication timing in the hypomethylated cells, are associated with a loss of allelic replication timing and shrinking of late replicating Partially Methylated Domain (PMD) boundaries. In contrast, conservation of replication timing after DNA methylation depletion at PMDs is associated with the formation of new H3K9me3/H3K4me3 bivalent domains which may serve to prevent ectopic transcription and maintain cell viability. Together our results show that a loss of global methylation, a common hallmark of cancer, directly impacts on the precision of replication timing and contribute to deregulation of the 3D chromatin architecture.		colorectal cancer cell line;HCT116

An increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which TRβ abrogates tumorigenesis could aid in understanding the core tumor suppressive program that TRβ facilitates. Here, we introduce TRβ into the MDA-MB-468 basal-like breast cancer cell line and perform RNA-sequencing to determine changes in transcriptomic signaling. The TRβ expressing MDA-MB-468 cells exhibit a more epithelial character as determined by PCA-PAM50 score and through repression of mesenchymal cytokeratins. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition pathway is also significantly reduced. The MDA-MB-468 dataset was also compared to RNA sequencing results from the thyroid cancer line SW1736 to determine which genes are TRβ regulated across both tissue types. Stearate biosynthesis was revealed as upregulated from the shared gene set, a lipid which is known to repress breast tumorigenesis, as were chromatin remodeling pathways. These data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which TRβ suppresses breast tumorigenesis and suggests a common metabolic role in breast and thyroid cancer as well a role for TRβ in the maintenance of epithelial cellular identity.		basal-like breast cancer cell line, with control vector, with T3 treatment;basal-like breast cancer cell line, with stable TRB expression, without T3 treatment;MDA-MB-468;basal-like breast cancer cell line, with stable TRB expression, with T3 treatment;pCDH-TRB;24 hours;basal-like breast cancer cell line, with control vector, without T3 treatment;pCDH-EV;10nM T3;vehicle (NaOH)

However, PC will ultimately evolve under the selection pressure of these therapies and progress to a lethal phenotype termed castration-resistant PC (CRPC). Recent studies suggest that de-differentiation away from an AR-driven luminal cell identity may be a key, early step. However, early therapy-induced mechanisms of prostate cancer cell de-differentiation are poorly understood. Here we show that the stem cell transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is transcriptionally repressed by AR, and de-repressed by enzalutamide. KLF5 expression is high in a subset of CRPC tissues, but low in primary adenocarcinoma. KLF5 functioned as oncogene in CPRC cells, promoting cellular migration, anchorage-independent growth, expression of basal cell markers, and transcriptional signatures of CRPC lineage plasticity, but had modest effects on cell proliferation. Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP)-sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments established a physical interaction between KLF5 and AR, and integrative analysis revealed that KLF5 and AR drive opposing transcriptional programs. We identified ERBB2 as a point of transcriptional convergence that was activated by KLF5 and repressed by AR. Accordingly, KLF5 expression levels in CRPC tissues correlated with predicted sensitivity to the dual EGFR inhibitor lapatanib, and the ERBB2-specific inhibitor mubritinib blocked KLF5-driven cell migration. Collectively, these findings implicate KLF5 as an AR-suppressed oncogene that drives early steps in CRPC de-differentiation and disease progression.		shKLF5-2;NA;shKLF5-1;R1-AD1;R1-AD1 prostate cancer cells;R1-D567;shCon;10-15;1 nM DHT;Prostate cancer;0.1% (v/v) ethanol;R1-D567 prostate cancer cells

We focused on differentially expressed proteins that had non-differential mRNA levels and were putatively targeted by a high number of miRNAs. SNX18, a sub-family member of sorting-nexins that participates in endocytosis and autophagy was down-regulated by 6-fold in WM266-4, and predicted to be targeted by 17 miRNAs. Over-expression of SNX18 in several melanoma cell-lines significantly reduced migration rate, while silencing of SNX18 resulted in the opposite effect. Notably, progression tissue microarrays demonstrated a trend for SNX18 downregulation in early metastasis. Luciferase assays confirmed the direct regulation of SNX18 by multiple miRNAs. Indeed, over-expression of these miRNAs repressed endogenous SNX18 expression at the protein but not mRNA level. Further, protein but not mRNA expression levels correlated with better overall survival as determined in a cohort of 48 metastatic melanoma patients and in the TCGA database. Mechanistically, SNX18-mediated reduced migration coincided with RhoA activation and Cdc42 inactivation. Both play a role, as RhoA inhibitor and constitutively activated Cdc42 mutants abrogated this effect. Moreover, phosphorylation-defective SNX18 mutants (S233A,S233D) migrated faster, with S233A inactivating RhoA and activating Cdc42, while S233D activated both. The downstream phosphorylation of the p38>MAPKAPK2>HSP27 signaling pathway was concordant. Both mutants were more abundant in the plasma membrane. Taken together, phosphorylation of S233 is crucial for SNX18 activation, but de-phosphorylation dynamics, which may occur at the membrane, is required for functional effect. mRNA expression profile of primary (WM115) and metastatic (WM266-4) melanoma cell lines.		skin metastasis;WM115;skin melanoma;skin primary tumor;WM266-4

This is particularly true in children, whom GI symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can replicate within the stomach. Here we show the novel derivation of gastric organoids from fetal, pediatric and adult biopsies and prove their value as in vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To facilitate infection, we induced a reversed polarity in our organoids (RP-GOs). The pediatric RP-GOs are fully susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, while the viral replication is significantly lower in organoids of fetal and adult origin. Transcriptomic analysis shows a moderate innate antiviral response and the lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we show how the virus can efficiently infect gastric epithelium, suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission.		negative paired control;Cultured organoid (RP-Gos) from adult stomach tissue (age 45 year);P5;infected at MOI 10;45-yo Gastric ORGs MOCK;infected at MOI 1;45-yo Gastric ORGs LOW dose;45-yo Gastric ORGs HIGH dose

However, not all tumors with a CD8+ T cell infiltrate respond to CBT, and little is known about the mechanisms governing CBT resistance in T cell-infiltrated NSCLC. We used a pre-clinical orthotopic NSCLC mouse model to study CBT-refractory CD8+ T cell responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that lung cancer-specific tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells exhibited clonal expansion but lacked expression of genes associated with effector and exhausted T cell responses, indicating that they underwent a differentiation program distinct from conventional T cell exhaustion. Mechanistic studies revealed that this lung cancer-specific T cell dysfunction program was established early during priming in the mediastinal lymph node. This program was characterized by robust T cell proliferation and acquisition of lung-homing factors but a failed upregulation of markers of effector and exhausted T cells. Intriguingly, CD8+ T cells from NSCLC patients expressed an analogous gene expression program which was associated with lung cancer specific T cell dysfunction and distinct from conventional T cell exhaustion. As a proof-of-concept that this lung cancer-specific T cell differentiation program could be therapeutically manipulated, we administrated recombinant IL-2 and IL-12, which was sufficient to restore effector T cell differentiation and induce control of lung tumors. These findings imply that a lung cancer-specific CD8+ T cell differentiation trajectory, activated during T cell priming in the mediastinal lymph node, limits the response of CD8+ T cells to CBT and thereby contributes to failed responses following CBT in T cell-infiltrated NSCLC.

CLUSTER guide RNAs can be genetically encoded and manufactured into viruses to work in various cell lines. They achieve on‐target editing on endogenous transcripts like GUSB and NUP43 with yields up to 45% without bystander editing and have been shown to recruit endogenous ADAR in vivo.

Methods: mRNA profiles of wild-type (WT) and Btn1a1-/-mice were generated by mRNA/cDNA library preparation (Illumina), qPCR quantitation, cluster generation and pair-end deep sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer) using an Illumina HiSeq SBS kit. Changes in mRNA levels (null/WT ≥ ± 2-fold; adjusted p ≤ 0.05) were assesed by GSEA and IPA analysis and compared with a proteomic analysis of the same sample set.. Results: Samples had 95-167 million pass filter reads (92% above Q30). Mapping of all samples was > 97% (mm10 reference genome). Significant changes in mRNA amounts accounted for 1.4% of 11,834 transcipts (113 up and 53 down regulated). Only 10 mRNA/protein pairs were significantly upregulated and one (Btn1a1) downregulated. Pathways and networks associated with inflammation, apoptosis and the cell cycle were upregulated and lipid synthesis and metabolism were downregulated. Biochemical and histochemical analysis confirmed that lactation is maintained in null animals, in the face of significant apoptosis, by the continual regeneration of secretory epithelial cells. Cell death proceeded through several pathways including activation of caspases 8 and 3 and not by the lysosomal lysis pathway predominant in WT cells Conclusions: Ablation of Btn1a1 has multiple effects on milk-secreting mammary cells, including disruption of lipid secretion, increased cell damage and death. Lactation is maintained by continuous regeneration of the epithelium. Expression of functional Btn1a1 is essential for the maintainance of terminally differentiated mammary cells and optimal milk production throughout lactation.

Despite an established contribution of nuclear membrane proteins to developmental gene regulation, little is known regarding the role of inner nuclear proteins. Here we demonstrate that loss of the nuclear scaffolding protein Matrin-3 (Matr3) in erythroid cells leads to morphological and gene expression changes characteristic of accelerated maturation, as well as broad alterations in chromatin organization similar to those accompanying differentiation. Matr3 protein interacts with CTCF and the cohesin complex, and its loss perturbs their occupancy at a subset of sites. Destabilization of CTCF and cohesin binding correlates with altered transcription and accelerated differentiation. This association is conserved in embryonic stem cells. Our findings indicate Matr3 negatively affects cell fate transitions and demonstrate that a critical inner nuclear protein impacts occupancy of architectural factors, culminating in broad effects on chromatin organization and cell differentiation.		untreated;differentiated;Mouse embryonic stem cell;MEL cells;Embryonic stem cell;Erythroleukemia cells;wild type;treated with 2%DMSO for 2 days;treated with 2%DMSO for 4 days;Matr3 -/-

For example, it causes accumulation of bone marrow (BM) B-cell precursors in spleen to convert into immunosuppressive Breg cells. Here, we provide evidence that cancer also coopts differentiation BM CSF1R+ Pax5Lo B-cell precursors to generate macrophages (termed B-MF cells). To do this, cancer uses CSF1 to trigger Csf1r signaling and downregulate PAX5 in B-cell precursors by activating FOXO1. Although tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are primarily derived from BM monocytes, our data suggest that some of them may have B-cell origin. Unlike monocyte-derived TAMs, B-MF exhibit a higher M2 polarization, more efficiently phagocytize apoptotic cells, induce FoxP3+ Tregs and suppress T cells activity. We propose that the cancer-B-MF axis is a novel immune escape pathway, thus a therapeutic target.

CLP1 is associated with the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex and the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, but its function remains unclear. We generated two mouse models of PCH10: one homozygous for the disease-associated Clp1 mutation, R140H, and one heterozygous for this mutation and a null allele. Both models exhibit loss of lower motor neurons and neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei. To explore whether Clp1 mutation impacts tRNA splicing, we profiled the products of intron-containing tRNA genes. While mature tRNAs were expressed at normal levels in mutant mice, numerous other products of intron-containing tRNA genes were dysregulated, with pre-tRNAs, introns, and certain tRNA fragments upregulated, and other fragments downregulated. However, the spatiotemporal patterns of dysregulation did not support a role in pathogenicity for most altered tRNA products. To elucidate the effect of Clp1 mutation on pre-mRNA cleavage, we analyzed poly(A) site (PAS) usage and gene expression in Clp1R140H/- spinal cord. PAS usage was shifted from proximal to distal sites in the mutant mouse, particularly in short and closely spaced genes. Many such genes also were expressed at lower levels in the Clp1R140H/- mouse, possibly as a result of impaired transcript maturation. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that select genes are particularly dependent upon CLP1 for proper pre-mRNA cleavage, suggesting that the contribution of mRNA 3’ processing to pathogenesis in PCH10 merits further investigation.

Deficit in this process is implicated in several psychiatric disorders. Here, we show that the transcription factor Tcf4 controls neuronal positioning during brain development. Tcf4-deficient neurons become mispositioned in clusters when their migration to the cortical plate is complete. We reveal that Tcf4 regulates the expression of cell adhesion molecules to control neuronal positioning. Furthermore, through in vivo extracellular electrophysiology, we show that neuronal functions are disrupted after the loss of Tcf4. TCF4 mutations are strongly associated with schizophrenia and cause Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, which is characterized by severe intellectual disability. Thus, our results not only reveal the importance of neuronal positioning in brain development and but also provide new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying neurological defects linked to TCF4 mutations.

CD4 T cells are critical to sustain immunity in chronic infections and cancer, yet little is known about how PD1/L1 modulates CD4 T helper (Th) responses or the ability to restore CD4 Th-mediated immunity by inhibiting PD1/L1 signaling. We demonstrate that PD1/L1 specifically suppresses CD4 Th1 cell amplification, prevents CD4 Th1 cytokine production, and abolishes CD4 CTL killing capacity during chronic infection. Inhibiting PDL1 during chronic infection rapidly restored these functions, while simultaneously enhancing Th1-like Treg amplification and activation, indicating a system-wide CD4-Th1 recalibration. Paradoxically, PDL1-blockade decreased TCR signaling, while re-directing intrinsically-suppressive type I interferon networks towards dominant IFNγ-mediated responses.

The importin α family of proteins mediates movement of specific cargo proteins when bound to importin β. Importin α genes have distinct expression patterns in mouse testis, implying they may have unique roles during mammalian spermatogenesis. Here we use a loss-of-function approach to specifically determine the role of importin α7 (Kpna6) in spermatogenesis and male fertility. We show that ablation of importin α7 in male mice leads to infertility and has multiple cumulative effects on both germ cells and Sertoli cells culminating in oligozoospermia. Importin α7-deficient mice exhibit an impaired Sertoli cell function, including loss of Sertoli cells from the seminiferous epithelium and a compromised nuclear transport of the androgen receptor. Furthermore, our data demonstrate devastating defects in spermiogenesis that are accompanied by a disturbed histone-protamine-exchange in elongating spermatids, resulting in incomplete sperm maturation and a massive loss of sperms. Our work uncovers the essential role of importin α7 in spermatogenesis and hence in male fertility.

Previous results have demonstrated that a subset of gene promoters, also termed Epromoters, works as bona fide enhancers and regulate distal gene expression. We hypothesised that Epromoters might play a key role in the coordination of rapid gene induction in the stress response, in particular during inflammation. Using a high-throughput reporter assay we explored the function of Epromoter in response to type I interferon. We found that STAT1/2 and IRF transcription factors preferentially bind to IFNa-induced Epromoters and distally regulate the activation of interferon-response genes. Similar observations were made in other types of inflammatory response. Our findings suggest that Epromoters might function as a hub to recruit key TFs required for coordinated regulation of gene clusters during the inflammatory response, and more generally upon cellular response to intra- and extra-cellular signals.

Recent studies revealed the contribution of tight control of glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), as well as fatty acid oxidation in the regulation of stem cell behavior. In this study, we show that how dysregulated glucose and triglyceride metabolism in T2DM/IGT affects the homeostasis of EPCs, i.e. bone marrow stem/progenitor cells (BMSCs). In our clinical study, consistent with previous reports, the patients with IGT or T2DM showed reduced level of circulating EPCs, as compared normal glucose tolerance. On the other hand, fasting or postprandial hypertriglyceridemia (hTG) itself did not affect the level of circulating EPCs. However, further analysis using single and multiple regression analyses strongly suggested that, in the presence of postprandial hTG, postprandial hyperglycemia exerts devastating effect on EPC homeostasis. We therefore carried out the proof of concept study in mice. Our experimental study revealed that repetitive glucose+lipid (G+L) spikes, but not repetitive glucose (G) spikes or lipid (L) spikes, rapidly upregulated p53 in BMSCs and induced premature aging phenotype of bone marrow cells, i.e. the impairment of BMSC quiescence and function, and myeloid-biased differentiation. Subsequent analysis implicated that p53-mediated augmentation of mitochondrial OXPHOS plays pivotal role for the impairment of BMSC quiescence and function. On the other hand, it is still not clear how repetitive G+L injection induced myeloid-biased differentiation. Because cell-fate decisions are executed by transcription factors in response to extracellular signals, and the best-known function of p53 is as a transcription factor, we asked to what extent repetitive glucose spikes and repetitive glucose+TG spikes affect transcriptional regulation in LSK cells.		glucose (G);PBS injected bone marrow LSK cells;PBS control;glucose+lipid (G+L);glucose injected bone marrow LSK cells;glucose+lipid injected bone marrow LSK cells;Lineage- Sca-1+ c-Kit+ cells

A prospective observational study was completed. Gut biopsies from patients with Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn’s Disease and Healthy donors were harvested. Using Fluorescence-activated cell sorting a purified CD14+/CD163+ intestinal macrophage population was isolated. RNA extracted and amplified from this population of macrophages was subjected to RNA-sequencing and bioinformatically analysed. The most relevant candidates were validated with RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Intestinal macrophages in UC and CD patients show a strong reprograming with over 1200 and 800 dysregulated genes, respectively. UC and CD intestinal macrophages showed an activated M1 inflammation associated to the attraction and activation of inflammatory T-cells and a Th1 immune response. Interestingly, macrophages from CD also showed a significant activation of M2 genes, associated with a Th2 response. Mirroring clinical observations, CD (but not UC) macrophages showed enrichment of expression of fibrotic and granuloma genes. Both UC and CD macrophages are down-regulating genes engaged in drug/xenobiotics metabolism roles key for IBD therapy (such as TPMT). Key genes such as MMP12 (fibrosis), CXCL9 (T-cell attraction) and CD40 (T-cell activation) were confirmed by RT-qPCR and also at the protein level by immunohistochemistry.		intestine;Normal Control;F;Not treated with immunosupression;Current smoker;M;systemic immunosupression;Crohn's Disease;macrophages;intestinal macrophages;NA;Ulcerative Colitis;Previous smoker;Never smoked

In addition to increased JAK-STAT and PI3K-AKT signaling, post-MPN sAML blast progenitor cells (BPCs) demonstrate increased nuclear β-catenin levels and TCF7L2 (TCF4) transcriptional activity. Knockdown of β-catenin or treatment with BC2059 that disrupts binding of β-catenin to TBL1X (TBL1) depleted nuclear β-catenin levels. This induced apoptosis of not only JAKi-sensitive but also JAKi-persister/resistant post-MPN sAML BPCs, associated with attenuation of TCF4 transcriptional targets MYC, BCL-2 and Survivin. Co-targeting of β-catenin and JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (rux) synergistically induced lethality in post-MPN sAML BPCs and improved survival of mice engrafted with human sAML BPCs. Notably, co-treatment with BET protein degrader ARV-771 and BC2059 also synergistically induced apoptosis and improved survival of mice engrafted with JAKi-sensitive or JAKi-persister/resistant post-MPN sAML cells. These preclinical findings highlight potentially promising anti-post-MPN sAML activity of combination of β-catenin and BETP antagonists against post-MPN sAML BPCs.

Clinical studies suggest that NASH is an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), but models and mechanisms linking these two diseases are lacking. Here, we have characterized the renal function, histological features, and transcriptomic profile in a well-validated murine NASH model generated by feeding a western diet (WD), with high contents of fat, fructose, and cholesterol, combined with a low dose of weekly IP carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). NASH mice developed significant glomerulosclerosis, tubular epithelial cell injury, and interstitial fibrosis at an intermediate stage (12 weeks). Animals with advanced NASH (24 weeks) displayed renal dysfunction, proteinuria, and renal fibrosis characterized by increased collagen deposition as tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Mice treated with a low dose of CCl4 alone did not develop renal injury, thereby excluding the possibility of CCl4-induced nephrotoxicity. Transcriptomic analysis of kidney cortices revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were highly enriched in mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP synthesis, and oxidative stress at the intermediate stage (12 weeks) and dysregulation of the immune response, lipid metabolic process, and insulin signaling pathways at the late stage (24 weeks). NRF-mediated oxidative stress pathway, Sirtuin signaling, and AMPK pathways were also highly enriched. Our results confirm a causative role of NASH in the development of CKD and reveal potential mechanisms of NASH-induced kidney injury. These findings establish valuable model to study the pathogenesis of NASH-associated CKD, an important feature of fatty liver disease that has been largely overlooked, yet has clinical and prognostic importance.

Dormancy is a non-proliferative state and is linked to late relapse and death. No targeted therapy is currently available to eliminate dormant cells, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding and reliable models. Here, we thoroughly characterize the dormant D2.OR and proliferative D2A1 breast cancer cell line models in vivo and in vitro, and assess if there is overlap between a dormant and a senescent phenotype. We show that D2.OR but not D2A1 cells become dormant in the liver of an immunocompetent model. In vitro, we show that D2.OR cells are polyploid ER+/Her2+ cells, and in response to a 3D environment are growth arrested in G1, of which a subpopulation resides in a 4NG1 state. The dormancy state is reversible, and not associated with a senescence phenotype. This will aid future research on breast cancer dormancy.

Here we show that improved glucose metabolism in hypothyroid mice after treatment of T3, the active form of thyroid hormone (TH), is accompanied with increased GLP-1 production and insulin secretion. Treatment of a GLP-1 receptor antagonist is able to attenuate the observed T3 effect on insulin and glucose levels, suggesting that GLP-1 is critically involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis by T3. By using a mouse model lacking hepatic TH receptor β (TRβ) and a liver-specific TRβ-selective agonist, we demonstrate that TRβ-mediated hepatic TH signalling is not only required for the regulation of GLP-1 production by T3 but also the insulinotropic and glucose-lowering effects of T3. Accordingly, administration of the liver-targeted TRβ-selective agonist is capable of increasing GLP-1 and insulin levels and alleviating hyperglycemia in diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, through suppressing CYP8B1 expression, T3 shapes the bile acid (BA) composition and increases the levels of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-antagonistic BAs, thereby potentiating the GLP-1 production and insulin secretion by repressing intestinal FXR signalling. Consistently, correlations between the T3 levels and either GLP-1 or FXR-antagonistic BA levels can be observed in euthyroid human subjects. Thus, our study reveals a previously undescribed role of hepatic TH signalling in glucose homeostasis through the regulation of GLP-1 production via BA-mediated FXR antagonism, which will underpin the development of novel therapeutics.

Acute Lung Injury (ALI) can cause Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a lethal condition with limited treatment options and currently a common global cause of death due to COVID-19-induced ALI. ARDS secondary to Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) has been recapitulated pre-clinically by anti-MHC-I antibody administration to LPS-primed mice. In this model, we demonstrated that inhibitors of PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates signaling pathways of fundamental importance to homeostasis and inflammation, prevented lung injury and increased survival. Treatment with PTP1B inhibitors attenuated the aberrant neutrophil function that drives ALI, and was associated with release of myeloperoxidase, suppression of Neutrophil Extracellular Trap (NET) formation, and inhibition of neutrophil migration. Mechanistically, reduced signaling through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, particularly to the activation of mTOR, was essential for these effects, linking PTP1B in hibition to promoting an aged neutrophil phenotype. Considering dysregulated activation of neutrophils is implicated in sepsis and can cause collateral tissue damage, we demonstrated also that PTP1B inhibitors improved survival and ameliorated lung injury in the LPS-induced sepsis model. Our data highlight PTP1B inhibition for prevention of TRALI and ARDS from multiple etiologies.		Balb/c;Control;MSI-1436;Neutrophils-control;Bone Marrow derived Neutrophils;Neutrophils-MSI-1436

We propose that synthetic triterpenoid RTA-408, an Nrf2 activator, activates additional protective pathways which stabilize soft tissue during radiation, thereby reducing necrosis and improves surgical outcomes in a subsequently created axial rotational flap. Methods: Experimental animal study utilizing Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 cohorts: (i) radiation + DMSO (inert vehicle), (ii) radiation + RTA-408 (therapeutic drug), and (iii) no radiation + DMSO. Two main groups of rats were utilized in these experiments: (i) rotational flap experiment (n=40) and (ii) transcriptome analysis (n=9). In the first experiment all animals in the radiation cohorts underwent 40 Gy of radiation to the soft tissue of the abdomen. Then all three cohorts underwent surgery with construction of an inferior epigastric axial rotational flap, which was performed 30 days after resolution of acute injury from radiation in the radiation groups. Percentage of flap necrosis, the primary endpoint, was calculated by standardized measurement of tissue necrosis by blinded observers and vascular density measured by CD31 staining. In a second experiment, an additional three cohorts, with identical treatment as described above underwent serial punch biopsies of the abdominal skin before, during, and after radiation and drug/vehicle control treatment. Transcriptome analysis utilizing gene set enrichment analysis and digital PCR were performed at the various timepoints. Results: In the first experiment, 40 rats were divided into the three groups and underwent treatment accordingly. The average flap necrosis was 20% (95% CI, 16-45%) in the radiation control group, 3% (95% CI, 0-11%) in the non-irradiated control, and 3% (95% CI, 0.2-10%) in the radiation group treated with RTA-408. Vascular density was preserved in the treatment group as compared to the radiated control. Nine rats were included in the second experiment, and transcriptome analyses in the treatment group revealed robust activation of antioxidant pathways with induced expression of genes associated with hypoxia and adipogenesis/angiogenesis. Conclusions: Administration of RTA-408 during radiation treatment in a rat model resulted in transcriptome changes which appear to mitigate the toxic effects of radiation, preserving capillary networks and improving flap survival and tissue healing after subsequent surgery. Such reductions in toxicity may have broad implications for functional outcomes and salvage surgery following therapeutic irradiation.

In order to explore the genes that cause WDL to obtain local invasion and distant metastasis capacities and transform it into DDL, The four DDL tissue specimens in this study were matched with four WDL tissue specimens according to baseline characteristics, such as gender, age, and recurrence, before high-throughput sequencing was conducted.

We hypothesize that RT-induced adipose tissue dysfunction contributes to the development of cardiometabolic disease in the expanding population of childhood cancer survivors. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue from adult childhood cancer survivors previously exposed to TBI, abdominal RT, or chemotherapy alone, alongside a group of healthy controls. We find that irradiated adipose tissue is characterized by a gene expression signature indicative of a complex macrophage expansion, which is also associated with dysregulated adipokine secretion. The full cohort is 30 subjects; however, 3 participants (2 in CHM group, 1 in CTL group) declined to share their sequencing data in a public database.		chemo;controls;abdominal RT;subcutaneous adipose tissue;TBI

We hypothesised that, in some patients, a state of postoperative systemic inflammatory dysregulation (PSID) exists increasing the risk or infection and sepsis, and that this will be associated with, and potentially predicted by, altered patterns of genome-wide peripheral blood mononuclear cell differential DNA methylation and gene expression. In this study we utilised phenotypic extremes of postoperative plasma C-reactive protein levels to define PSID, which manifested clinically in significantly higher rates of sepsis, complications and longer hospital stays following major abdominal surgery. We identified altered DNA methylation and differential gene expression in specific immune and metabolic pathways during PSID. Our findings suggest that dysregulation results in, or from, dramatic changes in differential DNA methylation and highlights potential targets for early detection and treatment. The combination of altered DNA methylation and gene expression confirms that dysregulation is mediated at multiple levels within specific gene sets and hence, non-specific anti-inflammatory treatments such as corticosteroids alone are unlikely to represent an effective therapeutic strategy.		postoperative;preoperative;High;66.9;339.7;Low;Peripheral blood;female;male

The effect and molecular mechanism of MA on pancreatic cancer cells remain elusive. Here, we explored the anti-tumor activity of MA on human pancreatic cancer cells and the potential underlying molecular mechanism. The anti-cancer effects of MA on whole-cell processes, including proliferation, migration, and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells, were systematically assessed by colony formation, transwell, and migration assays. The search for potential therapeutic targets was achieved via transcriptomics and proteomics analyses. MA was demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PANC-1 and Patu-8988 cells, but induced apoptosis of these cells. Several key candidate genes and proteins of functional relevance for the anti-tumor activity of MA were identified through the association analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics. To our knowledge, this is the first transcription and proteomics-based comprehensive analysis of the mechanism of MA against pancreatic cancer. The findings demonstrate that MA holds promise as a therapeutic drug for managing pancreatic cancer.		treated with  MA (40 uM) for 24 hours;untreated;PANC-1;PANC-1 cell lines
GSE181820	2021.09.17	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	22	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Highly Immunogenic Cancer Cells Require Activation of the WNT Pathway for Immunological Escape	PD-1 blockade therapy exerts antitumor effects by restoring the infiltration of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. While neoantigens arising from gene alterations in cancer cells comprise critical tumor antigens in antitumor immunity, a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring substantial tumor mutation burden (TMB) lack CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy. This resistance is an urgent issue, so the mechanism(s) mediating impaired antitumor immunity in highly mutated NSCLCs need to be explored. Here, we show that activation of the WNT/b-catenin signaling pathway contributes to the development of a noninflamed TME in tumors with high TMB. NSCLCs that lack immune cell infiltration into the TME despite high TMB preferentially upregulate the WNT/b-catenin pathway. Immunological assays revealed that those patients harbored neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood but not in the TME, suggesting impaired T cell infiltration into the TME due to the activation of WNT/b-catenin signaling. In our animal model, the accumulation of gene mutations in cancer cells increased CD8+ T cell infiltration into the TME, slowing tumor growth. However, further accumulation of gene mutations blunted antitumor immunity by excluding CD8+ T cells from tumors in a WNT/b-catenin signaling-dependent manner. Combined treatment with PD-1 blockade and WNT/b-catenin signaling inhibitors induced far stronger antitumor immunity than either treatment alone. We propose a mechanism-oriented combination therapy concept in the cancer immunotherapy field, i.e., the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with drugs that target specific molecules in cancer cell-intrinsic oncogenic signaling pathways involved in immune escape.

Here, we have performed high dimensional characterization of the pathophysiological and immune traits of aged COVID-19 convalescents, and correlated the local and systemic immune profiles with pulmonary function and lung imaging. In this cohort of aged COVID-19 convalescents, chronic lung impairment was accompanied by persistent systemic inflammation and respiratory immune alterations. Detailed evaluation of the lung immune compartment revealed dysregulated respiratory CD8+ T cell responses that likely underlie the impaired lung function following acute COVID-19 during aging. Single cell transcriptomic analysis identified the potential pathogenic subsets of respiratory CD8+ T cells causing persistent tissue conditions following COVID-19. Our results have revealed key pathophysiological and immune traits that support the development of lung sequelae following SARS-CoV2 pneumonia during aging, with implications for the treatment of chronic COVID-19 symptoms.		10x Genomics, Chromium Single Cell V(D)J;10x Genomics, Chromium Single Cell 5’;CD3+ T cell;PBMC and BAL;BAL

To identify common direct targets of mis-splicing by mutant U2AF1 and SRSF2, we performed RNA-Seq and eCLIP in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models. Integrative analyses of alternative splicing and differential binding converged on a long isoform of GNAS (GNAS-L), promoted by both mutant factors. MDS population genetics, functional and biochemical analyses support that GNAS-L is a driver of MDS and encodes a hyperactive long form of the stimulatory G protein alpha subunit, Gas-L, that activates ERK/MAPK signaling. SF-mutant MDS cells have activated ERK signaling and consequently are sensitive to MEK inhibitors. Our findings highlight an unexpected and unifying mechanism by which SF mutations drive oncogenesis with potential therapeutic implications for MDS and other SF-mutant neoplasms.		iPSC-HSPCs;11 - 13;none (input);CD34+/CD45+;anti-FLAG (Sigma F1804);SRSF2 mutation;Hematopoietic Differentiation as described in Chang et al.

We performed CODEX multiplexed tissue imaging and RNA sequencing on 70 tumor regions of advanced cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) from 14 patients enrolled in a clinical trial of pembrolizumab therapy. Clinical response was not associated with the frequency of tumor-infiltrating T cell subsets, but rather with striking differences in the spatial organization and functional immune state of the tumor microenvironment (TME). After treatment, pembrolizumab responders had a localized enrichment of tumor and CD4+ T cells, which coincided with immune activation and cytotoxic PD-1+ CD4+ T cells. In contrast, non-responders had a localized enrichment of Tregs pre- and post-treatment, consistent with a persistently immunosuppressed TME and exhausted PD-1+ CD4+ T cells. Integrating these findings by computing the physical distances between PD-1+ CD4+ T cells, tumor cells, and Tregs revealed a spatial biomarker predictive of pembrolizumab response. Finally, the chemokine CXCL13 was upregulated in tumor cells in responders post-treatment, suggesting that chemoattraction of PD-1+ CD4+ T cells towards tumor cells facilitates a positive outcome. Together, these data show that T cell topography reflects the balance of effector and suppressive activity within the TME and predicts clinical response to PD-1 blockade in CTCL.

Decidual macrophages display dynamic changes alone with pregnancy progress: During the peri-implantation phase, macrophages displayed a pro-inflammatory phenotype which facilitates embryo implantation. While, In the late firster trimester and second trimester, decidual macrophages are anti-proinflammatory which are helpful to pregnancy maintenance. Alterations in the ratio of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory decidual macrophages lead to abortion, preeclampsia, and preterm birth. Placenta-derived exosomes (pEXO) are critical in the immune cell modulation such as T cell apoptosis, NK activities, and T regulatory (Treg) differentiation. However, it is unknown whether placenta-derived exosomes contribute to decidual macrophage polarization during early pregnancy. Here we report that exosomes from the placenta explant stimulate M2 macrophage polarization via exosomal miRNA-30d-5p. Mechanistically, miRNA-30d-5p polarized macrophages to M2 phenotype by inhibiting HDAC9 expression. Furthermore, the conditioned medium of pEXO-treated macrophages promoted trophoblast migration and invasion. By contrast, conditioned medium impaired the ability of endothelial cell tube formation. However, pEXO-treated macrophages have no impact on T cell proliferation. Together, we demonstrated that pEXO promoted trophoblast migration and invasion, endothelial cell migration, and attenuation of endothelial cell tube formation by polarizing macrophage to decidua-like macrophage.		untreated;human monocyte-derived macrophage;treated with pEXO;M-CSF;buffy coat

Method: Splenic DCs from WT and Dcir-/- mice were colutured with T cells that express specific TCR for MOG35-55 for 3 days in the presence of MOG peptide. CD11c+ cells were collected by an auto MACS. RNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using DNBSEQ-G400. Results: We detected xxx gense that were higher expression in Dcir-/- DCs, compared with WT DCs, with a fold change ≥1.5 and p value <0.05. Conclusion: Our data showed that Dcir deficiency in DCs changed the gene expression pattern, compared to WT DCs, in the coculture system of T cells. DCIR regulates the expression of DC genes that are associated with the functions of DCs.		Dcir-/-;3-day culture;spleen;splenic DCs;wild type;C57BL/6

GSE184050	2021.09.16	Homo sapiens	GPL11154	TRUE	FALSE	116	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Novel diabetes gene discovery through comprehensive characterization and integrative analysis of longitudinal gene expression changes	Type 2 diabetes is a complex, systemic disease affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Previous research has identified genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes risk, however gene regulatory changes underlying progression to disease are still largely unknown. We investigated RNA expression changes that occur during diabetes progression using a two-stage approach. In our discovery stage, we compared changes in gene expression using two longitudinally collected blood samples from subjects who transitioned to type 2 diabetes between the time points against those who did not with a novel analytical network approach. Our network methodology identified 17 networks, one of which was significantly associated with transition status. This 822-gene network harbors many genes novel to the type 2 diabetes literature, but is also significantly enriched for genes previously associated with type 2 diabetes in GWAS. In the validation stage, we queried associations of genetically determined expression with diabetes-related traits in a large biobank with linked electronic health records. We observed a significant enrichment of genes in our identified network whose genetically determined expression is associated with type 2 diabetes and other metabolic traits and validated 31 gene-level associations that have never been reported by previous type 2 diabetes GWAS. Finally, we performed functional validation, demonstrating that the genes in this network are enriched in enhancers that operate in human pancreatic islet cells. We present an innovative and systematic approach that identified and validated key gene expression changes associated with type 2 diabetes transition status and demonstrated their translational relevance in a large clinical resource.		control subject 32, baseline;control subject 6, follow-up;case subject 14, baseline;control subject 27, follow-up;control subject 17, follow-up;T2D follow-up transcriptome;Control follow-up transcriptome;control subject 3, follow-up;case subject 5, follow-up;control subject 24, follow-up;control subject 2;control subject 1;control subject 4;control subject 24, baseline;control subject 3;case subject 21, baseline;control subject 6;control subject 5, baseline;control subject 5;case subject 7, baseline;case subject 8, follow-up;case subject 13, baseline;control subject 14, follow-up;control subject 10;control subject 11;control subject 31, baseline;control subject 16;control subject 17;case subject 15, baseline;control subject 16, baseline;control subject 18;baseline;control subject 19;control subject 12;case subject 13, follow-up;case subject 23, follow-up;control subject 13;control subject 14;control subject 15;case subject 21, follow-up;case subject 22, baseline;case subject 8, baseline;control subject 25, baseline;case subject 1, baseline;male;control subject 20;control subject 21;case subject 12, baseline;control subject 23, follow-up;control subject 22;case subject 2;case subject 3;case subject 5, baseline;control subject 33, follow-up;case subject 1;control subject 27;control subject 28;control subject 29;control subject 23;case subject 16, baseline;case subject 23, baseline;control subject 24;case subject 1, follow-up;control subject 25;control subject 13, follow-up;control subject 26;case subject 11, follow-up;control subject 7, follow-up;control subject 11, baseline;case subject 2, baseline;case subject 6;control subject 30, follow-up;case subject 7;case subject 4;case subject 10, follow-up;case subject 5;control subject 10, follow-up;control subject 20, follow-up;case subject 4, follow-up;case subject 8;case subject 20, follow-up;case subject 9;control subject 27, baseline;control subject 30;control subject 8, follow-up;control subject 31;control subject 3, baseline;control subject 32;control subject 33;control subject 14, baseline;control subject 31, follow-up;case subject 3, follow-up;control subject 21, follow-up;control subject 8;control subject 7;control subject 9;control subject 11, follow-up;control subject 9, follow-up;control subject 17, baseline;control subject 32, follow-up;control subject 22, follow-up;control subject 6, baseline;case subject 20, baseline;case subject 2, follow-up;control subject 12, follow-up;case subject 12, follow-up;control subject 13, baseline;control subject 2, baseline;case subject 15, follow-up;control subject 9, baseline;case subject 25, follow-up;case subject 3, baseline;control subject 28, baseline;case subject 10, baseline;case subject 18, follow-up;follow-up;control subject 21, baseline;case subject 20;case subject 21;female;case subject 24;case subject 18, baseline;case subject 25;case subject 22;case subject 23;case subject 6, follow-up;case subject 4, baseline;control subject 15, follow-up;control subject 25, follow-up;control subject 29, baseline;control subject 5, follow-up;control subject 22, baseline;case subject 17;case subject 18;case subject 15;case subject 16;control subject 8, baseline;Control baseline transcriptome;control subject 19, baseline;control subject 26, follow-up;case subject 19;case subject 10;case subject 19, baseline;case subject 25, baseline;case subject 13;control subject 12, baseline;control subject 16, follow-up;case subject 14;case subject 22, follow-up;control subject 1, baseline;case subject 11;T2D case;case subject 12;T2D baseline transcriptome;control subject 26, baseline;control subject 4, baseline;control subject 30, baseline;peripheral blood;case subject 19, follow-up;control subject 15, baseline;case subject 7, follow-up;control subject 7, baseline;case subject 24, follow-up;control subject 4, follow-up;control subject 18, follow-up;case subject 14, follow-up;control subject 18, baseline;control subject 1, follow-up;control subject 33, baseline;case subject 11, baseline;case subject 24, baseline;control subject 28, follow-up;case subject 9, follow-up;control;control subject 19, follow-up;control subject 10, baseline;case subject 9, baseline;case subject 17, follow-up;control subject 2, follow-up;control subject 23, baseline;case subject 17, baseline;control subject 29, follow-up;case subject 6, baseline;control subject 20, baseline;case subject 16, follow-up

Ability to adapt between environments is in part based on skin plasticity, indicating evolved homeostasis between skin and environment. This homeostasis reflects the greater relationship between the body and the environment, and disruptions in this balance may lead to accumulation of susceptibility factors for autoimmune disorders like psoriasis. We collected skin tissue biopsies from individuals with psoriasis and compared gene expression in psoriatic plaques to non-plaque psoriatic skin. We then compared these data with non-psoriatic skin transcriptome data from multiple primate species. We found 67 genes showing human-specific skin expression that are also differentially regulated in psoriatic skin; these genes are significantly enriched for skin barrier function, immunity, and neuronal development. We identified 6 gene clusters with differential expression in the context of human evolution and psoriasis, suggesting underlying regulatory mechanisms in these loci. Human and psoriasis-specific enrichment of neuroimmune genes shows the importance of the ongoing evolved homeostatic relationship between skin and external environment. These results have implications for both evolutionary medicine and public health, using transcriptomic data to acknowledge the importance of an individual's surroundings on their overall health.		elbow;lesional;lower back;nonlesional;Skin biopsy;upper arm;8.1;European;female;3.8;male

The pace of SC related study, however, is constrained partially by the technological limitations in generating genetically modified mice. Although the ease of use of CRISPR-Cas9 in genome manipulation has been documented in many cell lines and various species, its application in endogenous SCs remains elusive. In this study, we generated muscle-specific Cas9-expressing mice and achieved robust in vivo genome editing in juvenile SCs at the postnatal stage through AAV9 mediated short guide RNAs (sgRNAs) delivery. We also found adult quiescent SCs are reluctant to CRISPR/Cas9 editing despite efficient AAV9 transduction. To edit juvenile SCs in vivo, as a proof-of-concept, we delivered sgRNAs targeting MyoD, a key gene critical for muscle physiology and showed an efficient editing at MyoD locus, resulting in accumulation of SCs and defects in SCs differentiation which resembled the phenotypes reported in MyoD knockout mice. Further application of this system on potential key transcription factors (TFs) involved in SC fate transition, Myc, Bcl6 and Pknox2, unveiled their distinct functions in the early stage of SC activation and injury induced muscle regeneration. In addition, we revealed that Myc orchestrated SCs activation through impinging on 3D chromatin architecture. Altogether we established a robust muscle restricted CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing platform in endogenous SCs and elucidated the functionality of key factors governing SC activities.		quiescent muscle stem cell;6-8 weeks;Pax7-nGFP;Skeletal muscle;C57BL/6

PARP1 functions by adding ADP-ribose polymers (PAR) to proteins including itself, using NAD+ as a donor. This post-translational modification known as PARylation results in changes in the activity of PARP1 and its substrate proteins and has been linked to the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. PARP1 KO mice display schizophrenia-like behaviors, have impaired memory formation, and have defects in neuronal proliferation and survival, while mutations in genes that affect PARylation have been associated with intellectual disability, psychosis, neurodegeneration, and stroke in humans. Yet, the roles of PARP1 in brain development have not been extensively studied. We now find that loss of PARP1 leads to defects in brain development and increased neuronal density at birth. We further demonstrate that PARP1 loss increases the expression levels of genes associated with neuronal migration and adhesion in the E15.5 cerebral cortex, including Reln. This correlates with an increased number of Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells in vivo and in cultures of embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from the PARP1 KO cortex. Furthermore, PARP1 loss leads to increased NPC adhesion to N-cadherin, like that induced by experimental exposure to Reelin. Taken together, these results uncover a novel role for PARP1 in brain development, i.e., regulation of CR cells, neuronal density, and cell adhesion.		cortex;E15.5;WT cortex;PARP1 KO cortex;129S;WT;PARP1 -/-

To understand the gene regulatory principles underlying B cell maturation and the GC response we generated a single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas of the human tonsil, a widely studied, representative lymphoid tissue. We identify diverse immune cell subsets to help us map dynamic transcription factor activity during B cell activation, GC formation and plasma cell differentiation. We subsequently leverage cell type-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic maps to interpret the regulatory potential of fine-mapped autoimmune genetic variants. This reveals that many autoimmune disease-associated variants exhibit the greatest regulatory potential in GC-associated immune cell populations, providing a valuable cell-type resolved resource to understanding cellular and genetic causes underpinning autoimmune disease.		children and adults undergoing routine tonsillectomy;tonsil;Tonsil_scATAC-seq;Tonsil_scRNA-seq

Here, we characterized the CD8 T cell response against two co-expressed tumor neoantigens, SIINFEKL (SIIN) and SIYRYYGL (SIY), in a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. In this model, tumors are initiated in KrasLSLG12D;p53fl/fl (KP) mice by intratracheal installation of lentiviruses expressing Cre recombinase and the antigens as a fusion to luciferase (LucOS). In these KP LucOS mice, the CD8 T cell response peaks around 5 weeks post-tumor initiation and is dominated by expansion of cells specific to SIIN. SIY drives a much smaller T cell response, but it persists better over time. To further investigate phenotypic differences in the T cell responses against SIIN versus SIY, we subjected antigen-specific CD8 T cells from 5 week mice to paired single cell RNA and TCR sequencing using the 10X Genomics platform.

With aging, both HSC self-renewal as well as multi-lineage differentiation fidelity decline, a process determined by cell-intrinsic and –extrinsic factors. We here studied which aging-associated bone marrow (BM) alterations contribute to this process. Aged specific pathogen free (SPF) WT mice have increased systemic levels of microbial compounds compared to their young counterparts. This associates with increased steady-state IL-1a/b production by multiple BM cell populations. Aging-associated inflammatory transcriptional signatures and functional myeloid-differentiation bias in HSCs were mitigated in aged IL-1R1KO SPF and WT germ-free mice. Moreover, myeloid cells from aged mice produce more IL-1b and aged mice show higher and more durable IL-1a/b increase to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges. Reducing inflammatory burden in aged mice by inhibiting IL-1 signaling or by antibiotic treatment rejuvenate HSCs functions.

Their therapeutic effects are often attributed to their secretome, a proposition predicated on their long-term survival. However, the majority of MSCs do not survive in vivo administration. We sought to reconcile the immunosuppressive effects of MSC therapy with their short lifespan. We showed that almost all MSCs underwent apoptosis associated with caspase-3 activation within 1 hour of intravenous administration and were efferocytosed by lung phagocytes. The potent immunosuppressive effects of MSCs did not require them to remain viable, but instead involved efferocytosis-induced transcriptional changes in metabolic and inflammatory pathways in alveolar macrophages. We identified the mitochondrial pathway as the predominant mechanism involved in MSC apoptosis, as deletion of the effectors BAK/BAX prevented their death. Importantly, BAK/BAX deficiency in MSCs weakened their immunosuppressive effects in 2 different disease models used to define MSC potency. Our data showed that apoptosis of MSCs and their subsequent efferocytosis and macrophage immunometabolic reprogramming are key steps underlying their mode of action. These findings have significant implications for the development of MSC potency assays and biomanufacturing for clinical translation.		no;7-8 weeks old;yes;alveolar macrophages;Day12-UNS-MSC_alveolar macrophages;Day8-UNS-MSC_alveolar macrophages;day 12;bronchoalveolar lavage fluid;Day12-SEN-MSC_alveolar macrophages;Day8-UNS_alveolar macrophages;Day8-SEN_alveolar macrophages;day 8;Day8-SEN-MSC_alveolar macrophages;female;Day12-UNS_alveolar macrophages;Day12-SEN_alveolar macrophages;BALB/c

Within the small intestine, adult stem cells establish tissue cellularity, and may provide a means to control the abundance and quality of specialized epithelial cells. Nevertheless, we lack suitable approaches to identify biological targets and small molecules to modulate them. Here, we develop an extendable framework utilizing a physiologically-inspired organoid model to identify unknown, druggable regulators of intestinal stem cell differentiation that translate to intended manipulations in vivo. Specifically, we miniaturize and adapt an organoid model of Paneth cell differentiation to enable multiplexed phenotypic screening on the scale of thousands of samples, and employ longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing to understand hit biology. Strikingly, we identify that inhibitors of the nuclear exporter XPO1 modulate stem cell fate commitment, significantly increasing the abundance of Paneth cells independent of known differentiation cues. Our framework elucidates small molecules which modulate tissue stem cell biology and their underlying targets without the need for a priori knowledge of in vivo pathway biology.

In pancreatic islets, overt LD accumulation was detected in humans but not mice. LD buildup in islets was principally observed after roughly 11 years of age, increasing throughout adulthood under physiologic conditions, and also enriched in type 2 diabetes. To obtain insight into the role of LDs in human islet β cell function, the levels of a key LD scaffold protein, perilipin2 (PLIN2), were manipulated by lentiviral-mediated knock-down (KD) or over-expression (OE) in EndoCβH2-Cre cells, a human cell line with adult islet β-like properties. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion was blunted in PLIN2KD cells and improved in PLIN2OE cells. An unbiased transcriptomic analysis revealed that limiting LD formation induced effectors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that compromised the expression of critical β cell function and identity genes. These changes were essentially reversed by PLIN2OE or using the ER stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic acid. These results strongly suggest that LDs are essential for adult human islet β cell activity by preserving FFA homeostasis.		EndoCbH2-Cre;PLIN2KD;passage 75;Sham;EndoCbH2-Cre cells;PLIN2OE
GSE184015	2021.09.15	Mus musculus	GPL17021	TRUE	FALSE	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Targeting miR-126 in inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia inhibits leukemia development and leukemia stem cell maintenance	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring inv(16)(p13q22) expresses high levels of miR-126. Here we show that the CBFB-MYH11 (CM) fusion gene upregulates miR-126 expression through aberrant miR-126 transcription and perturbed miR-126 biogenesis via the HDAC8/RAN-XPO5-RCC1 axis. Aberrant miR-126 upregulation promotes survival of leukemia-initiating progenitors and is critical for initiating and maintaining CM-driven AML. We show that miR-126 enhances MYC activity through the SPRED1/PLK2-ERK-MYC axis. Notably, genetic deletion of miR-126 significantly reduced AML rate and extended survival in CM knock-in mice. Therapeutic depletion of miR-126 with an anti-miR-126 (miRisten) inhibited AML cell survival, reduced leukemia burden and leukemia stem cell (LSC) activity in inv(16) AML murine and xenograft models. Combination of miRisten with chemotherapy further enhanced the anti-leukemia and anti-LSC activity. Overall, this study provides molecular insights for the mechanism and impact of miR-126 dysregulation in leukemogenesis and highlights the potential of miR-126 depletion as a new therapeutic approach for inv(16) AML.		27.9ng/ul;CM/miR-126delta/delta;34.3ng/ul;LSK from mice bone morrow cells;26.5ng/ul;CM;18.2ng/ul;poly(I;C);pre-leukemic [6 weeks after poly(I;C) induction];20ng/ul;29.5ng/ul;16.1ng/ul;40.9ng/ul;bone morrow;21.1ng/ul;20.6ng/ul

Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) form a dense stromal network within GCs, but the full extent of their supportive activity is not understood. Here we showed that FDCs expressed IL4Ra and they reduced IL4 availability in GCs. We used scRNA-seq to examine IL4 actions within the GC and identified a subset of light zone cells marked by high IL4Ra and CD23 and lack of a Myc gene-expression signature. Trajectory inference analysis suggested this population could differentiate into pre-memory and pre-plasma cells. Genetic experiments showed that IL4Ra and STAT6 acted intrinsically to restrain pre-memory B cell generation. By reducing IL4 availability, FDCs enhanced GC B cell selection and fostered memory cell generation. This work suggests that GC FDCs provide a niche that limits bystander IL4 activity, focusing IL4 action on B cells undergoing selection and enhancing memory cell differentiation		Spleen;Reverse chimaeras were made by reconstituting irradiated Ccl19Cre/+ Il4raf/f  with wild type bone marrows;Reverse chimaeras were made by reconstituting irradiated Il4ra+/+ with wild type bone marrows;B220+ CD38- GL7hi;wild type;Day 14 after immunization with NP-haptenated antigen in alum adjuvant;Day 7 after immunization with NP-haptenated antigen in alum adjuvant;B220+ CD95hi GL7hi IgD-

Methods: RNA extracted from wild type and Brd4-/- CD8+T cells was used to generate RNA-seq library，followed by sequencing. Results: In naïve CD8+T cells, Brd4 deletion casued 956 downregulated genes and 841 upregulated genes. In in vitro-activated CD8+T cells（18hr），Brd4 deletion resulted in 1182 downregulated genes and 789 upregulated genes.

Here we found that the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase METTL3 is significantly up-regulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and associated with poor patient prognosis. Depletion of METTL3 results in decreased ESCC growth and progression in vitro and in vivo. We further established ESCC initiation and progression models using Mettl3 conditional knockout mouse and revealed that Mettl3 mediated m6A modification is essential for promotes ESCC initiation and progression in vivo. Moreover, using METTL3 overexpression ESCC cell model and Mettl3 conditional knockin mouse model, we demonstrated the critical function of Mettl3 in promoting in vivo ESCC tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, Mettl3 catalyzed m6A modification promotes NOTCH1 expression and the activation of Notch signaling pathway. Forced activation of Notch signaling pathway successfully rescues the growth, migration and invasion capacities of METTL3 depleted ESCC cells. Our data uncovered important mechanistical insights underlying ESCC tumorigenesis and provided molecular basis for the development of novel strategies for ESCC diagnosis and treatment.		normal;TE-10;m6A (202003 - Synaptic Systems);METTL3-knockdown;esophageal epithelial cell line TE-10;esophageal epithelial cell line;non;esophagus;m6A (202004 - Synaptic Systems)

We therefore sought to examine the effect of UL status on the gene expression profile of the lesional scalp in CCCA patients. Scalp biopsy was obtained from 16 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CCCA between 2017 and 2020. Microarray analysis was used to identify differential gene expression between CCCA patients with and without a history of UL. Of the 20,000 genes analyzed, 23 of 25 genes with highest expression in CCCA patients with UL held no statistical significance. No genes previously implicated in FPDs were found among the upregulated transcripts. Of all genes analyzed, only 8 upregulated genes and zero downregulated genes had a fold change >2 in CCCA patients with UL compared to CCCA patients without UL.

Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway could affect the antimicrobial immune responses by suppressing T cell activity. Several recent studies demonstrated that blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway exacerbated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, the influence of blocking this pathway in pulmonary Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) infection was not fully understood. Objective: We aimed to determine the influence of genetic depletion of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway on the disease activity of MAC infection. Methods: Wild-type, PD-1-deficient mice and PD-L1-deficient mice were intranasally infected with Mycobacterium avium bacteria. Measurements and Main Results: The depletion of PD-1 or PD-L1 did not affect mortality and bacterial burden in mice infected with MAC. However, remarkable infiltration of CD8 T lymphocytes was observed in the lungs of PD-1 and PD-L1 deficient mice compared to wild-type mice. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis showed that levels of gene expressions related to Th1 immunity did not differ according to the genotypes. However, genes related to the activity of CD8 T cells and related chemokine activity were up-regulated in the infected lungs of PD-1 and PD-L1 deficient mice. Conclusions: Depletion of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway did not affect the activation of Th1 immunity in response to MAC infection, which may explain why MAC infection was controlled in these mice. In addition, CD8-positive T cell pulmonary inflammation in knockout mice might have some clinical implication in the treatment of cancer patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors when the patients are infected with MAC.

Its role in regulating stem cell fate is unclear. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence that nucleolar stress induced by interfering rRNA biogenesis can drive two-cell stage embryo-like (2C-like) transcriptional program and induce an expanded 2C-like cell population in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Mechanistically, the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) mediated by rRNA and nucleolar proteins maintains the formation of peri-nucleolar heterochromatin (PNH). When mES cells undergo rRNA biogenesis defect, the normal LLPS of nucleolus is disrupted, causing deconjugation of NCL/TRIM28 complex on PNH and changes of epigenetic state and 3D structure of PNH, which leads to Dux, a conserved multicopy retrogene defining the cleavage-specific transcriptional program in placental mammals, to be released from the PNH region, activation of 2C-like program and transition of mES cells to 2C-like cells. Embryos with rRNA biogenesis defect are incompatible to develop from 2-cell (2C) to blastocyte (BC) and appear to skew from the blastocyst to earlier cleavage embryo signatures. Our results highlight that nucleolar LLPS-mediated 3D chromatin structure reshaping of PNH compartment regulates the fate transition of mES cells to 2C-like cells. Our findings for the first time elucidate the novel roles of rRNA biogenesis in regulating the 2C-like and ES state homeostasis in cultured cells and suggest that rRNA biogenesis is a new molecular switch from nucleolus-unmatured 2C stage to nucleolus-matured BC stage during murine pre-implantation embryo development.		untreated;ICM-derived ES cells;ES cells;CX-5461

This approach is only modestly sensitizing and is also toxic to non-mutant bearing wild-type cells. To explore potentially exploitable genetic interactions with spliceosome mutations, we combined data mining and functional screening for synthetic lethal interactions with an Srsf2P95H/+ mutation. Analysis of mis-splicing events in a series of both human and murine SRSF2P95H mutant samples across multiple myeloid diseases (AML, MDS, CMML) was first performed to identify conserved mis-splicing events. From this analysis, we identified that the DNA repair and cell cycle pathways were overrepresented within the conserved mis-spliced transcript sets. In parallel, to functionally define pathways essential for survival and proliferation Srsf2P95H/+ cells, we performed a genome-wide pooled CRISPR loss of function screen using Hoxb8 immortalised R26-CreERki/+ Srsf2P95H/+ and R26-CreERki/+ Srsf2+/+ cell lines. We assessed for loss of sgRNA representation at three timepoints: immediately after Srsf2P95H/+ activation, and at one week and two weeks post Srsf2P95H/+ mutation. Pathway analysis demonstrated that the DNA damage response and cell cycle pathways were amongst the top synthetic lethal pathways with Srsf2P95H/+ mutation., Based on the loss of guide RNAs targeting Cdk6, we identified that Palbocilib, a CDK6 inhibitor, showed preferential sensitivity in Srsf2P95H/+ cell lines and in primary non-immortalised lin-cKIT+Sca-1+ cells compared to wild type controls. Our data strongly suggest that cell cycle and DNA damage response pathways are required for Srsf2P95H/+ cell survival, and that Palbociclib could be an alternative therapeutic option for targeting SRSF2 mutant myeloid cancers.

We reported previously that ADAR1 is functionally important for thyroid cancer progression and A-to-I editing events are elevated in these tumors. However, the downstream effectors regulated or edited by ADAR1 and the significance of ADAR1 dysregulation in thyroid cancer remain unclear. Here we provide insight, by whole transcriptome sequencing, into the consequences of ADAR1 dysregulation on global gene expression, RNA splicing and RNA editing. Furthermore, we describe for the first time an oncogenic function for CDK13 in thyroid cancer and identified a new ADAR1-dependent RNA editing event that occurs in the coding region of its transcript. Moreover, CDK13 was significantly over-edited in tumor samples and our functional analysis revealed the importance of this specific editing event in promoting cancer cell hallmarks. Finally, we showed that the editing of CDK13 modifies its subcellular localization and that this event could explain, at least in part, the global change in splicing produced by ADAR1 dysregulation. In summary, our data reinforces A-to-I editing as an important pathway in cancer progression, identifying novel mechanisms that open new insights into future treatments in thyroid and other cancer types.

We assessed the protein interactome of lipins 1, 2, and 3 in hepatocytes, and identified unique protein associations between lipin 1 and U2 mRNA spliceosome components. Lpin1–/– mouse liver exhibited aberrant mRNA splicing in the fasted state, including mRNAs involved in mRNA processing and liver maturation. Aberrant splicing could be induced in cultured hepatocytes by lipin 1 knockdown or elevated phosphatidic acid levels, suggesting a role for lipin 1 PAP activity in splicing fidelity. Refeeding Lpin1–/– animals after fasting largely restored mRNA splicing fidelity. Reduced levels of ESRP2 splicing factor exclusively in the fasted state of Lpin1–/– liver was associated with widespread aberrant exon inclusion.

The quality and amount of liver RNA was evaluated using a qubit RNA assay (Invitrogen R11490) and run on an Biorad Bioanalyzer Chip to verify RNA integrity. RNASeq library was prepared by using Illumina TruSeq RNA library construction protocol. RNA samples from 24 mice-fed AIN-93 M diet and 24 mice-fed HFCA diet were submitted to the David H. Murdock Research Institute (DHMRI) for sequencing. The RNA-seq libraries were constructed from 1 µg total RNA after poly-A library preparation. The pooled libraries were sequenced on two lanes of the Illumina HiSeq2500 Instrument. Results: Our liver transcriptomic analysis of eight mouse strains shows that diet and genetic background have a strong effect on the liver transcriptome, which may be related to differences in cardo-metabolic traits. We calculated a gene module consisting of highly correlated transcripts that enriched the biological pathway and provided a searchable database of liver transcript profiles. To further investigate the association of hepatic gene modules with cardio-metabolic traits, Fmo3, a key enzyme in the production of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and Nox4, which showed strong association with plasma TMAO and liver triglyceride, were identified as the highest expressed in the laboratory-like inbred strains (B6, 129 and NZO) and the lowest expressed transcripts in the CAST strain. We found differences in the production of TMAO and liver triglyceride, which contributes to metabolic syndrome, depending on genetic backgrounds. Conclusions: Our study provide a valuable data resource to the research community and show that liver transcriptomic analysis identified diet- or strain-specific pathways to pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.		liver;WSB/EiJ;Liver;129S1/SvlmJ;NZO/HILtJ;CAST/EiJ;C57BL/6J;High fat/cholic acid diet;24 weeks;PWK/PhJ;Female;AIN-93M diet;wild type;NOD/ShiLtJ;A/J

The mechanism through which TREM2 contributes to the disease (TREM2 activation vs inactivation) is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed changes in a gene set downstream of TREM2 to determine whether TREM2 signaling is modified by AD progression. We generated an anti-human TREM2 agonistic antibody and defined TREM2 activation in terms of the downstream expression changes induced by this antibody in microglia developed from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following TREM2 activation were compared with the gene set extracted from microglial single nuclear RNA sequencing data of patients with AD, using gene set enrichment analysis. We isolated an anti-TREM2-specific agonistic antibody, Hyb87, from anti-human TREM2 antibodies generated using binding and agonism assays, which helped us identify 300 upregulated and 251 downregulated DEGs. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that TREM2 activation may be associated with Th2-related pathways. TREM2 activation was lower in AD microglia than in microglia from healthy subjects or patients with mild cognitive impairment. TREM2 activation also showed a significant negative correlation with disease progression. Pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs controlled by TREM2 activity indicated that TREM2 activation in AD may lead to anti-apoptotic signaling, immune response, and cytoskeletal changes in the microglia. We showed that TREM2 activation decreases with AD progression, in support of a protective role of TREM2 activation in AD. In addition, the agonistic anti-TREM2 antibody can be used to identify TREM2 activation state in AD microglia.		iPS microglia treated with Hyb87;PBS;Control IgG;iPS microglia treated with control IgG;iPS microglia treated with PBS;iPS microglia;Hyb87

We expressed a constitutively active form of Nfatc2, and the closely related Nfatc1, in human islets and identified ~5,600 differentially expressed genes. Nfatc2 binding sites in human islets were identified via ChIP-seq, yielding ~8,600 high-confidence peaks. By integrating gene expression changes induced by Nfatc2 with genomic binding sites for Nfatc2, we identified ~2,200 direct transcriptional targets of Nfatc2 in human islets. Direct targets that were induced by Nfatc2 were enriched for transcripts that regulate the cell cycle, and for motifs associated with the transcription factor FoxP1. We showed that islets from an endocrine-specific FoxP1, FoxP2 and FoxP4 triple-knockout mouse are less responsive to Nfatc2-induced β-cell proliferation, suggesting the FoxP family may work in concert with Nfatc2 to regulate β-cell proliferation. Nfatc2 induced β-cell proliferation in both mouse and human islets, whereas Nfatc1 does so only in human islets. Exploiting this species difference in Nfatc1-responsiveness, we identified ~250 direct transcriptional targets with similar transcriptional profiles. This gene set strongly enriches for cell cycle-associated transcripts, and includes the nuclear hormone receptor, Nr4a1. We show that deletion of Nr4a1 greatly reduces the capacity of Nfatc2 to induce β-cell proliferation, suggesting that much of the effect on Nfatc2 occurs through its induction of Nr4a1. Integration of ncRNA profiling, chromatin accessibility and Nfatc2 binding sites enabled us to identify key Nfatc2-dependent enhancer loci that mediate enhanced β-cell proliferation.

However, little is understood regarding the role native P4, signaling through the progesterone receptor (PR), plays in formation of breast tumors. Studies published by our lab highlighted a link between PR and immune signaling pathways, suggesting PR induces PR to repress the interferon signaling pathway. Given these findings, we sought to investigate whether P4/PR drive immunomodulation in the mammary gland and development of mammary gland tumors. We found that mice treated with P4 displayed changes in the mammary gland suggesting inhibited immune response compared to placebo-treated mice. Furthermore, transgenic mice with PR overexpression demonstrated decreased numbers of immune cell populations in their mammary gland, lymph nodes, and spleens. Upon long-term monitoring, we determined that multi-parous PR overexpressing mice developed significantly more mammary gland tumors than control mice. Additionally, tumors of PR overexpressing mice contained fewer infiltrating immune cells. Finally, RNA sequencing analysis of tumor samples revealed that immune-related gene signatures were enriched in tumors of control mice compared to tumors of PR overexpressing mice. Together, these findings provide a novel mechanism behind P4-mediated promotion of mammary gland tumor development and provide rationale to investigate anti-progestin treatment to promote immune-mediated elimination of mammary gland tumors.

Previous reports suggest that T-type calcium channels may be involved in the adult hippocampal neurogenesis, however, function of T-type calcium channels in newly generated cells is still uncertain. We demonstrated that Cav3.1 is predominantly localized in the NPCs in mouse SGZ, and that deletion of Cav3.1 attenuates proliferation and survival in 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled new born cells in the hippocampal DG. To reveal mechanism underlying impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis in Cav3.1 KO mice, gene expression in the hippocampal DG is compared between WT and Cav3.1 KO mice.

Many efforts have been devoted to tracking precursor cells in circulating blood and bone marrow by detection of BRAFV600E alleles and to exploring the differentiation potential of LCH-related myeloid cells in vitro. However, their cellular and molecular alterations remain unclear. Here, we constructed a single-cell transcriptional landscape of more than 3,000 monocytes and DCs from treatment-naïve pediatric LCH and targeted-therapy pediatric LCH cohorts, unraveling patient to patient heterogeneity and underlying molecular mechanisms of BRAF inhibitor, respectively. In parallel, we further investigated the precise relationship between circulating potential precursors and pathological LCH clusters based on unbiased joint analysis. In addition, we found that the proportion of pDC in Lin-HLA-DR+ population is closely linked with the severity of the disease, providing a novel promising indicator to optimize the stratification strategy. Taken together, our data update the molecular understanding of LCH biology, which might contribute to improvement of clinical therapeutics and promotion of the personalized medicine.

Genetic polymorphisms in the IFNL3/IFNL4 locus have been associated both with poor clearance of HCV and protection from liver fibrosis, an early stage of cirrhosis. Here, we aimed to address the genetic and functional relationships between IFNL3/IFNL4 polymorphisms, cirrhosis, and HCC risk. We evaluated associations between IFNL4 genotype (presence of rs368234815-dG or rs12979860-T alleles) with cirrhosis and HCC risk in patients with chronic HCV - 2,931 from Taiwan and 3,566 from Japan, and with gene expression and somatic mutations in 370 HCC tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Functional analyses were performed in primary human hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells and a panel of hepatoma HepG2 cell lines with gene-edited IFNLR1 and inducible expression of IFN-λ3 or IFN-λ4. We detected associations between IFNL4 genotype and decreased risk of cirrhosis (OR=0.66, 95%CI=0.46-0.93, P=0.018, in Taiwan), but increased risk of HCC in patients without HCV clearance (OR=1.28, 95%CI=1.07-1.52, P=0.0058, in Japan). IFNL4 genotype was also associated with reduced cell proliferation and enrichment of CTNNB1 mutations in HCC tumors in TCGA. Reduced proliferation in hepatic cells was contributed by intracellular accumulation of IFN-λ4 leading to induction of ER stress and enhanced IRF1 signaling. The strong anti-proliferative effects of IFN-λ4 in hepatic cells could explain the association of IFNL3/IFNL4 polymorphisms with decreased cirrhosis. However, by sustaining persistent HCV infection, IFN-λ4 may contribute to the development of CTNNB1 mutations and increased risk of HCC in patients without viral clearance.

However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Using dexamethasone-induced FGR and protein restriction-influenced FGR mouse models, we observed learning and memory deficits in adult FGR offspring. FGR induces decreased hippocampal neurogenesis from the early postnatal period to adulthood by reducing the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs). We further found a persistent decrease of Tet1 expression in hippocampal NSCs of FGR mice. Mechanistically, Tet1 downregulation results in hypermethylation of the Dll3 and Notch1 promoters and inhibition of Notch signaling, leading to reduced NSC proliferation. Overexpression of Tet1 activates Notch signaling, offsets the decline in neurogenesis, and enhances learning and memory abilities in FGR offspring. Our data indicate that a long-term decrease in Tet1/Notch signaling in hippocampal NSCs contributes to impaired neurogenesis following FGR and could serve as potential targets for the intervention of FGR-related cognitive disorders.		postnatal day 3;Intrauterine growth retardation group (IUGR);postnatal 8-week;hippocampus;normal saline group (NS);T1_Male_D3;C1_Male_D3;wildtype;C2_Male_8W;C57BL/6J;T2_Male_8W;male

Methods: Total mRNA was extracted from IECs which were isolated from small intestines of Mst4 KO mice and WT mice (8 weeks) in triplicate respectively. Then RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and the sample reads were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform. As a reasult, we got the transcript data using Hisat2 followed by Stringtie. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays. Results: We mapped about 60 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome and identified about 50,000 transcripts in IECs of mice. Apprioximately 2,000 transcripts showed different expression between Mst4 KO and WT IECs, with a fold change ≥2 and p value <0.05. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed a significantly negative enrichment of Wnt/b-catenin target genes and altered expression of 15 genes was confirmed with qRT–PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Conclusion: Our study present the datiled transcripts analysis of IECs isolated from small intestines, with biologic replicates. Based on RNA-seq transcriptome characterization , we conclude a molecular mechanism of MST4 regulating intestinal stem cell homeostasis and provide a framework to understand the crosstalk of MST4 and Wnt/b-catenin signaling.		post natal week 8;Mst4 KO;small intestine;intestinal epithelia;WT;C57BL/6

We focused on differentially expressed proteins that had non-differential mRNA levels and were putatively targeted by a high number of miRNAs. SNX18, a sub-family member of sorting-nexins that participates in endocytosis and autophagy was down-regulated by 6-fold in WM266-4, and predicted to be targeted by 17 miRNAs. Over-expression of SNX18 in several melanoma cell-lines significantly reduced migration rate, while silencing of SNX18 resulted in the opposite effect. Notably, progression tissue microarrays demonstrated a trend for SNX18 downregulation in early metastasis. Luciferase assays confirmed the direct regulation of SNX18 by multiple miRNAs. Indeed, over-expression of these miRNAs repressed endogenous SNX18 expression at the protein but not mRNA level. Further, protein but not mRNA expression levels correlated with better overall survival as determined in a cohort of 48 metastatic melanoma patients and in the TCGA database. Mechanistically, SNX18-mediated reduced migration coincided with RhoA activation and Cdc42 inactivation. Both play a role, as RhoA inhibitor and constitutively activated Cdc42 mutants abrogated this effect. Moreover, phosphorylation-defective SNX18 mutants (S233A,S233D) migrated faster, with S233A inactivating RhoA and activating Cdc42, while S233D activated both. The downstream phosphorylation of the p38>MAPKAPK2>HSP27 signaling pathway was concordant. Both mutants were more abundant in the plasma membrane. Taken together, phosphorylation of S233 is crucial for SNX18 activation, but de-phosphorylation dynamics, which may occur at the membrane, is required for functional effect. In this study we compared the proteome, transcriptome and miRnome of primary and metastatic melanoma isogenic cell-lines and identified SNX18 as a novel inhibitor of melanoma migration.

GSE184055	2021.09.14	Mus musculus	GPL10333	TRUE	FALSE	2	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Hepatic thyroid hormone signalling modulates glucose homeostasis through the regulation of GLP-1 production via bile acid-mediated FXR antagonism	A greater understanding of the glucose homeostasis mediated by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) will facilitate the development of novel glucose-lowering treatments. Here we show that improved glucose metabolism in hypothyroid mice after treatment of T3, the active form of thyroid hormone (TH), is accompanied with increased GLP-1 production and insulin secretion. Treatment of a GLP-1 receptor antagonist is able to attenuate the observed T3 effect on insulin and glucose levels, suggesting that GLP-1 is critically involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis by T3. By using a mouse model lacking hepatic TH receptor β (TRβ) and a liver-specific TRβ-selective agonist, we demonstrate that TRβ-mediated hepatic TH signalling is not only required for the regulation of GLP-1 production by T3 but also the insulinotropic and glucose-lowering effects of T3. Accordingly, administration of the liver-targeted TRβ-selective agonist is capable of increasing GLP-1 and insulin levels and alleviating hyperglycemia in diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, through suppressing CYP8B1 expression, T3 shapes the bile acid (BA) composition and increases the levels of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-antagonistic BAs, thereby potentiating the GLP-1 production and insulin secretion by repressing intestinal FXR signalling. Consistently, correlations between the T3 levels and either GLP-1 or FXR-antagonistic BA levels can be observed in euthyroid human subjects. Thus, our study reveals a previously undescribed role of hepatic TH signalling in glucose homeostasis through the regulation of GLP-1 production via BA-mediated FXR antagonism, which will underpin the development of novel therapeutics.		liver,fasting;liver;liver,feeding;male

Of these, effector memory CD45RA-expressing CD8+ T cells (Temra) have been discovered and characterized as the most terminally differentiated subset. However, their exact ontogeny and physiological importance in association with tumor progression remain poorly understood. We analyzed primary tumors and peripheral blood samples from 26 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and analyzed their phenotypes and functional characteristics using flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatics. We found that tumor-infiltrating Temra (tilTemra) cells largely differ from peripheral blood Temra (pTemra), with distinct transcriptomes and functional properties. Notably, although majority of the pTemra was CD27-CD28- double-negative (DN), a large fraction of tilTemra population was CD27+CD28+ double-positive (DP), a characteristic of early-stage, less differentiated effector cells. Trajectory analysis revealed that CD8+ TILs undergo a divergent sequence of events for differentiation into either DP or DN tilTemra. Such a differentiation toward DP tilTemra relied on persistent expression of CD27 and CD28 and was associated with weak T cell receptor engagement. Thus, a higher proportion of DP Temra was correlated with lower immunogenicity of tumor antigens and consequently lower accumulation of CD8+ TILs. These data suggest a complex interplay between CD8+ T cells and tumors and define DP Temra as a unique subset of tumor-specific CD8+ TILs that are produced in patients with relatively low immunogenic cancer types, predicting immunogenicity of tumor antigens and CD8+ TIL counts, a reliable biomarker for successful cancer immunotherapy.

The molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage dysfunction and its control in diabetes are largely unexplored on an epigenetic level. Here, we report that acetyl histone-H3 (Lys27), an epigenetic mark regulating the macrophage transcriptome, is lost in the hostile tissue microenvironment in diabetes. The diabetic microenvironment, profoundly suppresses the acetylation of histone by activating HDACs-dependent deacetylation pathways. This, in consequence, suppress the STAT1 signaling in macrophages maintained in diabetic conditions. Interestingly, the HDAC inhibitor butyrate - via restoring the acetyl histone-H3 (Lys27)-dependent transcriptome - effectively rescues macrophage functions in a diabetic microenvironment. Butyrate reinstalls the STAT1 mediated transcription program and consequently macrophage activity depicting a unique fingerprint of tissue regeneration and inflammation control even in a hostile diabetic microenvironment. Most interesting, butyrate breaks the vicious cycle of inflammation in diabetic wounds. Our study offers novel pathogenic insight and the unique opportunity to reverse perturbed macrophage function thus holding promise to successfully treat diabetic and other chronic wounds and conditions of unrestrained inflammation.		db/db;total skin;WT;C57BL/6;Macrophage

Most of such substrates is hydrolyzed by proteasomes. Different forms of proteasomes are known. The role of immunoproteasomes (iPs) and intermediate proteasomes (intPs) is emerging. Here, using a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase technology a panel of four cell lines was obtained. Cells of histiocytic lymphoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, cervix adenocarcinoma and hepatocarcinoma origin were modified to express proteasomes with mCherry-tagged β5i subunit, which is a catalytic subunit of iPs and intPs. Importantly, the chimeric gene expression in modified cells is under control of endogenous regulatory mechanisms and was increased following IFN-γ and/or TNF-α stimulation. Fluorescent proteasomes are catalytically active and were distributed within the nucleus and cytoplasm of the modified cells. RNAseq revealed marginal differences in gene expression profile between modified and initial cell lines, predominate metabolic pathways and a pattern of expressed receptors were determined for each cell line. Using obtained cell-lines it was shown that anti-cancer drugs ruxolitinib, vincristine and gefetinib stimulate the expression of β5i-containing proteasomes which might have an impact on the disease prognosis. Taken together, obtained cell lines represent convenient platform to study the immunoproteasome gene expression, localization of iPs and intPs, association of proteasomes with other proteins and many other aspects of proteasome biology under the influence of various drugs and conditions in real time and in living cells.		cell culture;HepG2;original cells;SW620;mCherry knock-in cells;TZM-bl;U937

Through the scRNA-seq pipeline, we clustered 1,441 single cells from four non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549, H460, H1299 and Calu3) into four groups based on differential gene expression and detected over 2,400 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from a comparison of four clusters following dimension reduction. We validated fold change values of 120 DEGs selected from three cluster comparisons (top 20 up- and top 20 down-regulated genes per cluster comparison) using qRT-PCR approach. We performed further quantitative validation of chemokine genes (CXCL1 and CXCL2 with corresponding receptor, CXCR2) at mRNA level in tumour and tumour-adjacent normal lung tissues of LUAD patients (16 female and 19 male). Next, we profiled microRNAs epigenetically regulating expression of those chemokine genes in the tumour and normal tissues as well as blood (plasma) samples from corresponding LUAD patients. Finally, we identified relatively high copy number of miR-532-5p regulating those chemokine genes in patient plasma samples.

The molecular mechanisms underlying dissemination of gastric cancer cells to distant organs are unknown. Here, we show that the ELK3 gene is necessary for migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. The ELK3 gene modulates expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling-related genes such as LOXL2, SERPINF1, COL16A1, NID1, and SNAI1 to facilitate cancer cell dissemination. Our in silico analysis indicated that ELK3 expression was positively correlated with these ECM remodeling-related genes in gastric cancer cells and human gastric cancer patients. High expression of ELK3 and other ECM remodeling-related genes was also closely associated with a worse prognosis of gastric cancer patients. These findings suggested that ELK3 acts as an important regulator of gastric cancer dissemination by regulating ECM remodeling.

The thalamus is a likely site of secondary damage because of its reciprocal connections with the cortex. Using a mouse model of mild cortical injury that does not directly damage subcortical structures (mTBI), we found a chronic increase in C1q expression specifically in the corticothalamic circuit. Increased C1q expression co-localized with neuron loss and chronic inflammation, and correlated with disruption in sleep spindles and emergence of epileptic activities. Blocking C1q counteracted these outcomes, suggesting that C1q is a disease modifier in mTBI. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing demonstrated that microglia are the source of thalamic C1q. Since the corticothalamic circuit is important for cognition and sleep, which can be impaired by TBI, this circuit could thus be a new target for treating TBI-related disabilities.

We report the strong expression of transmembrane channel-like 4 (TMC4) in the circumvallate and foliate papillae projected to the glossopharyngeal nerve, mediating a high-concentration of NaCl. Electrophysiological analysis using HEK293T cells revealed that TMC4 was a voltage-dependent Cl- channel and the consequent currents were completely inhibited by NPPB, an anion channel blocker. This channel could be activated without an increase in intracellular calcium ion. TMC4 allowed permeation of organic anions including gluconate, but their current amplitudes at positive potentials were less than that of Cl-. Tmc4-deficient mice showed significantly weaker glossopharyngeal nerve response to high-concentration of NaCl than the wild-type littermates. These results indicated that TMC4 is a novel chloride channel that responds to high-concentration of NaCl.

The development of a TB vaccine that induces durable and effective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is urgently needed. Complete and early Mtb control can be induced in M. bovis Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccinated hosts when the innate immune response is targeted to generate effective vaccine-induced immunity. In the present study, we show that the superior and early Mtb control that is mediated by innate activation of DCs is associated with mucosal localization of clonal activated vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells in the lung. Our studies also show that the lung epithelial cell signaling through the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFKB pathway is critical for the mucosal localization of activated vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells for rapid Mtb control. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the immune mechanisms that can overcome TB vaccine bottlenecks and provide early rapid Mtb control.

Elevated NAD+ has been shown to improve the function of some adult stem cells, with implications that these changes could lead to sustained improvement of the tissue or system. We examined the effect of elevating NAD+ levels in models with reduced hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) potential (ATM-deficient and aged mice) and show that supplementation of NR, a NAD+ precursor, leads to improved lymphoid lineage potential and long-term cell-autonomous benefits. Transcriptional profiles from HSCs show changes driven by NR repress myeloid gene signatures, which may lead to the increased lymphoid output. Our work characterizes the improved lymphoid-potential from short-term NR treatment in functionally compromised HSCs and highlights potentially detrimental aspects of supplementing NAD+ to proficient systems.

As the top candidate, DLX5 exhibits a notable bifurcate re-configuration of its bivalent promoter in cancer. Specifically, DLX5 maintains a bivalent state in normal tissues; it undergoes de novo DNA hypermethylation and transcriptional repression in multiple non-SCC cancers. In stark contrast, DLX5 promoter gains active histone marks and becomes transcriptionally activated in SCCs, which is mediated directly by SOX2. Functionally, DLX5 is essential for SCC viability, migration, anchorage-independent growth and xenograft proliferation. Mechanistically, DLX5 interacts and cooperates with TP63 to regulate ~2,000 enhancers and promoters, which converge on activating cancer-promoting pathways. Together, our data establish a novel and strong SCC-promoting factor, and elucidate a new epigenomic mechanism - bifurcate chromatin re-configuration - during cancer development.

However, the mechanism regulating T cell brain homing in LBD is unknown. Here, we observed T cells adjacent to Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurons in post-mortem LBD brains. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified upregulated expression of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) in CD4+ T cells in LBD. CSF protein levels of the CXCR4 ligand, C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12) were associated with neuroaxonal damage in LBD. Furthermore, we observed clonal expansion and upregulated Interleukin 17A expression by CD4+ T cells stimulated with a phosphorylated α-synuclein epitope. Thus, CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling may represent a mechanistic target for inhibiting pathological interleukin-17-producing T cell trafficking in LBD.

However, whether and how lymphocyte-stem/TA cell contact affects ISC differentiation is largely unknown. Here, we uncover a novel role of T cell-stem/TA cell contact in ISC fate decisions. We show that intestinal lymphocyte depletion results in skewed ISC differentiation in mice, which can be rescued by T cell transfer. Mechanistically, integrin αEβ7 expressed on T cells binds to E-cadherin on ISCs and TA cells, triggering E-cadherin endocytosis and the consequent Wnt and Notch signaling alterations. Blocking αEβ7—E-cadherin adhesion suppresses Wnt signaling and promotes Notch signaling in ISCs and TA cells, leading to defective ISC differentiation. Thus, αEβ7+ T cells regulate ISC differentiation at single-cell level through cell-cell contact-mediated αEβ7—E-cadherin adhesion signaling, highlighting a critical role of the T cell-stem/TA cell contact in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.

Genomic safe harbors (GSHs) are regions of the genome that can maintain the expression of transgenes without disrupting the transcriptome of host cells. With recent advances in genome editing technology, GSHs play an increasingly important role in improving the efficiency and safety of genome engineering. However, limited candidate GSHs have been identified. In addition, many parameters currently used to identify GSHs are not knowledge based and none of the current available GSHs meet all the ideal safety requirement. In this study, we use the polymorphic mobile element insertions (pMEIs) that naturally occur among healthy human populations to facilitate GSHs searching. By integrating pMEIs with epigenomic signatures and 3D chromatin organization information, we developed a framework to map cell typespecific GSHs. We applied our framework to pMEIs identified in the 1000 Genomes project and GTEX projects and identified novel GSHs Candidates in blood and brain cells. We further validated that a transgene cassette integrated in one novel GSH can be stably transcribed without affecting normal proliferation and differentiation of host cells. We also developed a user-friendly program to search for GSHs in different population and cell types.

Mammary tissue undergoes development and remodeling during lactation, a stage associated with high susceptibility to bacterial infections, inducing an inflammatory condition called mastitis. Although the immune response of the mammary gland has been the subject of intense research to improve prevention and treatment efficacy, the precise definition of its immune composition at this particular physiological stage is still missing. We combined single-cell RNA-Seq, flow cytometry, and three-dimensional confocal microscopy techniques to characterize the immune landscape of lactating murine mammary tissue. Macrophages dominated the immune cell repertoire and could be subdivided into at least two subsets: ductal and stromal macrophages. Ductal macrophages represented approximately 80% of the total CD45pos immune cells and co-expressed F4/80 and CD11c, with high levels of MHC class II molecules. They were strategically poised below the alveolar basal cells in contact with the myoepithelial cell network. Adaptive T and B lymphocytes were remarkably less numerous at this stage, which could explain the limited efficacy of vaccination against mastitis. These results support the view that new strategies to increase mammary immunity and prevent mastitis should be devised.

Nevertheless, approximately 20-30% of cases progress to tumors or erythroderma, resulting in poor outcome. At present, factors contributing to this switch from indolent to aggressive disease are only insufficiently understood. Methods: In patients with advanced-stage MF, we compared patches with longstanding history to newly developed plaques and tumors by using single-cell RNA sequencing, and compared results with early-stage MF as well as nonlesional MF and healthy control skin. Results: Despite considerable inter-individual variability, lesion progression was uniformly associated with downregulation of the tissue residency markers CXCR4 and CD69, the heat shock protein HSPA1A, the tumor suppressors and immunoregulatory mediators ZFP36 and TXNIP, and the interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) within the malignant clone, but not in benign T cells. This phenomenon was not only found in conventional TCR-αβ MF, but also in a case of TCR-γδ MF, suggesting a common mechanism across MF subtypes. Conversely, malignant cells in clinically unaffected skin from MF patients showed upregulation of these markers. Conclusions: Our data reveal a specific panel of biomarkers that might be used for monitoring MF disease progression. Altered expression of these genes may underlie the switch in clinical phenotype observed in advanced-stage MF.		patch;plaque;Single Cell 5' PE;lesional;tumor;nonlesional;Mycosis fungoides;lesional/early;healthy control;skin biopsy;follow up;early stage

While the majority of reported cases still relates to direct substance effects, there is increasing evidence that microbiome-dependent metabolism of xenobiotic substances likewise has direct adverse effects on the host. This can be due to microbial biotransformation of compounds, interaction between the microbiota and the host’s endogenous detoxification enzymes or altered xenobiotic bioavailability. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) are among the most abundant environmental pollutants and contaminants. Yet, effects of the skin microbiota on B[a]P absorption, metabolism and distribution in humans remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that skin microbiota do metabolize B[a]P on and in human skin in situ, using a recently developed commensalic skin model. In this model microbial metabolism leads to high concentrations, of known microbial B[a]P metabolites on the surface as well as in the epidermal layers. In contrast to what was observed for uncolonized skin, metabolite as well as B[a]P concentrations were subject to altered rates of skin penetration and diffusion, resulting in up to 58 % reduction of metabolites recovered from basal culture medium. The results indicate the reason for this altered behavior to be a microbial induced change of the epidermal barrier function. Compared to uncolonized models, commensal colonization led to strengthening of tight junctions (TJ) as well as increased epidermal differentiation in the form of increased expression of E-cadherin, K10, FLG and IVN. Concomitantly colonized models showed decreased formation and penetration of the ultimate carcinogen Benzo[a]pyrene-7, 8-dihydrodiol-9, 10-epoxide (BPDE), leading, in consequence, to fewer BPDE-DNA adducts formed. Befittingly, transcript and expression levels of key proteins for repairing environmentally induced DNA-damage such as XPC were also found to be reduced in the commensalic models, as was expression of B[a]P-associated cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases (CYPs) such as CYP1A1. The results show that the microbiome can have significant effects on the toxicology of external chemical impacts. The respective effects rely on a complex interplay between microbial as well as host metabolism and microbe-host interactions all of which cannot be adequately assessed using single-system studies. Given the high species-specificity of such interactions adequate toxicological assessments should thus increasingly rely on complex human models wherever possible.

More recently, this process of mitochondrial dynamics has been demonstrated to be highly sensitive to nutrient supply, ultimately conferring bioenergetic plasticity to the organelle. However, whether regulators of mitochondrial dynamics play a causative role in nutrient regulation remains unclear. In this study, we generated a cellular loss-of-function model for dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), the primary regulator of outer membrane mitochondrial fission. Loss of DRP1 (shDRP1) resulted in extensive ultrastructural and functional remodeling of mitochondria, characterized by pleomorphic enlargement, increased electron density of the matrix, and defective NADH and succinate oxidation. Despite increased mitochondrial size and volume, shDRP1 cells exhibited reduced cellular glucose uptake and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Untargeted transcriptomic profiling revealed severe downregulation of genes required for cellular and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, inhibition of ATP-stimulated calcium flux, and impaired substrate oxidation stimulated by calcium levels. The insights obtained herein suggest that DRP1 regulates fatty acid oxidation by altering whole-cell and mitochondrial calcium dynamics. These findings are relevant to the targetability of mitochondrial fission and have clinical relevance in the identification of treatments for fission-related pathologies such as hereditary neuropathies, inborn errors in metabolism, cancer, and chronic diseases.		early stage myotubes;C2C12 cell lysate;2-5

Here, we show that therapeutically targeting the COX-2/PGE2/EP2-4 pathway with widely used non-steroidal and steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs synergized with ICB in mouse cancer models. We exploited a bilateral surgery model to harness the heterogeneity in treatment outcome and distinguish responders from non-responders shortly following treatment.

Nevertheless, it is currently unknown whether microglia activation could also be a primary event leading to neurodegeneration in PD. We have generated a new mouse model with strictly selective alpha-Synuclein (aSYN) accumulation in microglial cells by inducible gene expression through lentiviral transduction in the nigral tissue. Surprisingly, these mice develop progressive and restricted degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons without any sign of aSYN endogenous aggregation. aSYN accumulating microglial cells exhibit a strong inflammatory status with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Bulk and scRNA-sequencing of the immune cellular infiltrate identify a complex cellular composition with numerous peripheral populations of the innate and adaptive immune system with specific transcriptional signatures. Molecular profiling and functional assessment reveal that intoxicated microglia develop exhausted phagocytosis and high production of oxidative molecules creating a molecular feed-forward vicious cycle with IFNg secreting immune cells infiltrated in the brain parenchyma. In these animals, pharmacological inhibition of the oxidative and nitrosative molecule production is sufficient to attenuate neurodegeneration. These results suggest that aSYN accumulation in microglia exerts selective DA neuronal degeneration by promoting phagocytic exhaustion, excessive toxic environment and selective recruitment of peripheral immune cells.

However, the precise mechanisms coupling tricarboxylic (TCA) acid cycle intermediates to CD4 T cell differentiation remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that a-ketoglutarate (aKG) increased Th1 polarization while significantly inhibiting regulatory T cell (Treg) generation. Consistent with these data, aKG promoted the effector profile of Treg-polarized chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells against the ErbB2 tumor antigen. Mechanistically, aKG altered the transcription of >250 membrane-related genes, decreasing membrane fluidity and inducing a robust lipidome-wide remodelling. The massive increase in storage and mitochondria lipids was associated with a significantly augmented OXPHOS. Notably, inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase activity, the bridge between the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain, enforced Treg generation. Thus, our study identifies novel connections between aKG, lipidome remodeling and OXPHOS in CD4 T cell fate decisions.		Naive_Tcell;DMK;NT;Treg;Th1;untreateted_unpolarized_day0

To do so, we performed an unbiased screening using RNAsequing. With this technique, we identified, in two human breast cancer metastatic cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3), 13 commonly significant modulated genes that are involved in metabolic switches. Five of these genes were confirmed by RT-qPCR, and four were proved at protein level. In vivo experiments using an orthotopic model of the highly metastatic cell line MDA-MB-231 further demonstrated that modulation of some of the target genes can be observed in mice without tumor recurrence and without lung micrometastasis. Together, our results identified members of signaling pathways induced by mtROS in human metastatic breast cancer cells, and demonstrated that targeting mtROS in metastatic breast cancer can impair their invasive phenotype.

However, the molecular processes by which germline variants contribute to somatic lesions are poorly understood. We performed targeted sequencing in 5,008 patients and identified a key regulatory germline variant in GATA3 strongly associated with Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL). By creating an isogenic cellular model with a CRISPR-Cas9 system, we showed that this variant activated a strong enhancer that significantly upregulated GATA3 transcription, which in turn reshaped the global chromatin accessibility and 3D genome organization. Remarkably, this genotype switch induced a chromatin loop between the CRLF2 oncogene and a distal enhancer, similar to the somatically acquired super-enhancer hijacking event in patients. GATA3 genotype-related alterations in transcriptional control and 3D chromatin organization were further validated in Ph-like ALL patients. Finally, we showed that GATA3 directly regulates CRLF2 and potentiates the oncogenic effects of JAK-STAT signaling in leukemogenesis. Altogether, our results provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which a germline non-coding variant contributes to oncogene activation epigenetic regulation and 3D genome reprogramming.

Underlying biological processes involve induced massive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) by aberrant fibroblasts. We subjected diseased primary human lung fibroblasts to an advanced 3D phenotypic high-content assay and screened a library of FDA/EMA approved small molecules for inhibiting ECM deposition. Fibrotic Pattern Detection by Artificial Intelligence (FANTAIL) identified Tranilast as an effective inhibitor, however, by structure-activity relationship studies we found N-(2-butoxyphenyl)-3-(phenyl)acrylamides (N23Ps) as a novel and highly potent compound class. N23Ps suppressed myofibroblast transdifferentiation, ECM deposition, cellular contractility, and altered cell shapes, thus advocating a unique mode of action. Mechanistically, transcriptomics identified SMAD (de)ubiquitination/Smurf2 as a potential therapeutic target network. Antifibrotic activity of N23Ps was verified by proteomics in a human ex vivo tissue fibrosis disease model, suppressing profibrotic markers SERPINE1/PAI1 and CXCL8/IL8. Conclusively, these data suggest N23Ps as a novel class of highly potent compounds with implications for inhibiting organ fibrosis in patients.		cmp4;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast, control, biological replicate 1;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast;TGFb1;control;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast treated with TGFb1, biological replicate 1;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast  treated with cmp4, biological replicate 1;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast treated with TGFb1, biological replicate 2;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast treated with TGFb1, biological replicate 3;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast treated with TGFb1 and cmp4, biological replicate 2;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast treated with TGFb1 and cmp4, biological replicate 1;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast treated with TGFb1 and cmp4, biological replicate 3;TGFb1 and cmp4;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast  treated with cmp4, biological replicate 3;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast  treated with cmp4, biological replicate 2;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast, control, biological replicate 2;IDF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)-derived primary pulmonary fibroblast, control, biological replicate 3

Even though its development starts early in utero, neonatal skin is still immature at birth relative to adult and undergoes a maturation process extending to the first years of life. It is now established that stratum corneum is thinner and dryer, and that skin contains less natural moisturizing factors and lipids in newborns compared to children and adults. Moreover, it has been shown that skin surface area expansion is not linear throughout life and is peaking perinatally, suggesting that baby skin has a higher epidermal cellular turnover. Despite growing resources showing differences between adult and infant skin physiology, molecular and metabolic specificities of baby skin are still poorly understood. To address this critical knowledge gap, we performed an integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic study comparing human primary keratinocytes from babies and adults. Based on state-of-the-art integrative frameworks, our analyses revealed a major shift in the global energetic metabolism in baby keratinocytes compared to adults, highlighting increased amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in baby cells to fuel TCA cycle, while showing glycolysis as the major cell energy source in adult cells.

The majority of patients non-responsive to front line treatment with steroids have an estimated overall 2-year survival rate of only 10%. Treatment options for steroid-refractory acute GVHD are limited. Bromodomain and Extraterminal Domain (BET) inhibitors PLX51107 and PLX2853, deemed safe in human clinical trials in high risk malignancies, significantly downregulate pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 responses without impacting T regulatory cells, improving survival in murine models of acute GVHD while retaining beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effects. Modulation of the IL23/STAT3 axis via BET inhibition resulted in a reduction of pathogenic Th1/Th17 cells in the spleen and acute GVHD target organs such as the gastrointestinal tract.

In this study, we aimed to further clarify the molecular function of DLEU1 in the pathogenesis of OSCC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis revealed that knockdown of DLEU1 induced substantial changes in the levels of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in OSCC cells. Notably, depletion of DLEU1 significantly downregulated levels of H3K4me3/H3K27ac and expression of a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) including IFIT1, IFI6 and OAS1, while ectopic DLEU1 expression activated these genes. Western blot analysis and reporter assay suggested that DLEU1 upregulates ISGs through activating the JAK-STAT signaling in OSCC cells. Moreover, IFITM1, one of the ISGs induced by DLUE1, is frequently overexpressed in primary OSCC tumors, and knockdown of IFITM1 attenuated OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Our data suggest that DLEU1 exerts its oncogenic function through, at least in part, activating a series ISGs in OSCC cells.		Ca9-22;DLEU1;control

Individuals with ID exhibit deficits in intelligence and impaired adaptive behavior, frequently as well as visual impairments. Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) is an interacting partner of fragile X mental retardation protein, whose loss results in fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of ID. Recently, CYFIP2 variants were found in patients with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, and ID. Individuals with these CYFIP2 variants often exhibit visual impairments, however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In the current study, we investigated the role of Cyfip2 in retinal and visual function by generating and analyzing mice in which Cyfip2 is depleted in the retina (Cyfip2 CKO mice). We found no major difference in the layer structure and cell composition between control and Cyfip2 CKO retinas, whereas a subset of genes associated with transporter and channel activity was differentially expressed in the Cyfip2 CKO retina. Multi-electrode array recordings showed more sustained and stronger response to positive flashes of ON ganglion cells in the Cyfip2 CKO retina, although we did not observe that Cyfip2 deficiency affects photoreceptor and ON bipolar cell functions by electroretinogram analysis. Furthermore, initial and late phase OKR analysis demonstrated that Cyfip2 deficiency impairs visual function at the organismal level. Together, our results shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying visual impairments observed in individuals with CYFIP2 variants and, more generally, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders including ID.

SJIA and MAS are also associated with an unexplained emerging inflammatory lung disease (SJIA-LD), with our recent work supporting pulmonary activation of IFN-gamma pathways as a pathologic link between SJIA-LD and MAS. Our objective was to mechanistically define the novel observation of pulmonary inflammation in the TLR9 mouse model of MAS. In acute MAS, lungs exhibit mild but diffuse CD4-predominant, perivascular interstitial inflammation with elevated IFN-gamma, IFN-induced chemokines, and alveolar macrophage expression of IFN-gamma-induced genes. Single-cell RNA-sequencing confirmed IFN-driven transcriptional changes across immune and parenchymal lung cell types. Resolution of MAS was associated with increased alveolar macrophage and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration. alveolar macrophage microarrays confirmed IFN-gamma-induced proinflammatory polarization during acute MAS, which switches towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype during MAS resolution. Interestingly, recurrent MAS led to increased alveolar inflammation and lung injury, and reset alveolar macrophagepolarization towards a proinflammatory state. Furthermore, in mice bearing macrophages insensitive to IFN-gamma, both systemic feature of MAS and pulmonary inflammation were attenuated. These findings demonstrate that experimental MAS induces IFN-gamma-driven pulmonary inflammation replicating key features of SJIA-LD, and provides a model system for testing novel treatments directed towards SJIA-LD.

GSE163150	2021.09.12	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Transcriptome analyses reveal tau isoform-driven changes in transposable element and gene expression	Purpose: Overexpression of tau isoforms has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, and abnormal tau expression is correlated with genomic instability. The purpose of this study is to use RNA-sequencing and molecular biological techniques to determine if there are any unique genomic consequences associated with overexpression of one or more tau isoforms. Methods: SHSY-5Y cells were infected in triplicate with lentiviruses to induce overexpression of 3R and 4R tau isoforms, were treated with amyloid-beta oligomers or DMSO, and were differentiated into neurons using retinoic acid. After RNA collection via TRIzol, poly(A)-selected, 100 bp, paired-end library preparation and sequencing were completed by the IGM Genomics Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 that was purchased with funding from a National Institutes of Health SIG grant (#S10 OD026929). Trimmed FASTQ files were aligned to GRCH38 using STAR and differential expression of genes and transposable elements was determined using DESeq2 and software from TEToolkit (available from the Hammell Lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Results: Our RNA-seq analysis revealed similar gene and transposable element expression patterns between cells overexpressing tau isoforms and patients with Alzheimer's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy. We found widespread differential expression particularly in L1 and Alu transposable elements and upregulation of genes related to extracellular matrix organization, focal adhesions, and cell junctions, among other biological processes. Conclusions: Our study is the first to our knowledge to examine locus-specific transposable element expression in the context of tauopathies, and to our knowledge is the first to specifically examine transposable element expression stemming from overexpression of tau isoforms. Our study provides additional evidence that transposable elements may play a role in tauopathies and provides further insight into the locations of transposable element expression in the genome in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.		0N3R and 1N4R tau lentivirus (1:1), MOI 20 each at time of plating;DMSO (Control group) for 24 hours prior to collection;Retinoic acid-differentiated SHSY-5Y cells;1N4R tau lentivirus, MOI 20 at time of plating;Empty vector lentivirus, MOI 20 at time of plating;Neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells;50 nM amyloid-beta 42 oligomers for 24 hours prior to collection;0N3R tau lentivirus, MOI 20 at time of plating

In contrast, we found that those on thymic stromal cells were similarly expanded but gradually lost their potential to T cell lineage. To know the molecular machinery to retain their potential, we compared their profiles of the transcripts by microarray analysis. Expression of three genes (Meis1, Hmga2 and Lmo2) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming their difference in the stemness-related genes. It was revealed that Lmo2 is responsible for the maintenance of T-cell differentiation potential among them. Thereafter, the expression profiles were also compared between Ebf1-deficient pro-B cell lines without the potential and their enforced transfectants of Lmo2, showing the downstream targets of Lmo2 in early lymphoid progenitor cells.

GSE158892	2021.09.12	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	7	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			scRNAseq analysis of mouse L4 whole dorsal root ganglions following sciatic nerve cush, dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury	After an injury in the adult mammalian central nervous system, lesioned axons fail to regenerate. This failure to regenerate contrasts with the remarkable potential of axons to grow following an injury in the peripheral nervous system. Peripheral sensory neurons with cell soma in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) switch to a regenerative state after nerve injury to enable axon regeneration and functional recovery. Decades of research have focused on the signaling pathways elicited by injury in sensory neurons and in Schwann cells that insulate axons as central mechanisms regulating nerve repair. However, neuronal microenvironment is far more complex and is composed of multiple cell types including endothelial, immune and glial cells. Whether the microenvironment surrounding neuronal soma contribute to the poor regenerative outcomes following central injuries remains largely unexplored. To answer this question, we performed a single cell transcriptional profiling of the DRG neuronal microenvironment response to peripheral and central injuries. In dissecting the roles of the microenvironment contribution, we have focused on a poorly studied glia population of Satellite Glial Cells (SGC) surrounding the neuronal cell soma. Upon a peripheral injury, SGC contribute to axon regeneration via Fatty acid synthase (Fasn)-PPARα signaling pathway. Our analysis reveals that in response to central injuries, SGC do not activate the PPAR signaling pathway. However, induction of this pathway with fenofibrate, an FDA- approved PPARα agonist used for dyslipidemia treatment, rescued axon regeneration following an injury to the central nerves. Collectively, our results uncovered a previously unappreciated role of the neuronal microenvironment differential response in central and peripheral injuries.		uninjured;spinal cord injury;L4 DRG spinal cord injury;dorsal root crush;Dorsal root ganglion (L4);8-12 weeks;L4 DRG uninjured;L4 DRG sciatic nerve crush;L4 DRG dorsal root crush;C57BL/6;sciatic nerve crush
GSE152256	2021.09.12	Homo sapiens	GPL20795	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			LncRNA SNHG17 contributes to proliferation, migration and poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been substantially reported to have critical roles in regulating tumorigenesis recent years. However, the expression pattern and biological function of SNHG17 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclearly. Bioinformatics analysis and qRT-PCR were performed to detect the expression pattern of SNHG17 in HCC tissues, adjacent non-tumorous tissues and cell lines. The effect of SNHG17 on proliferation, migration and apoptosis of HCC were investigated by knockdown and overexpressing SNHG17 in HCC cell lines. RNA sequencing was utilized to explore the underlying mechanism. Utilizing publicly available TCGA-LIHC, GSE102079 HCC datasets and qRT-PCR, we found SNHG17 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines and was notably associated with larger tumor size, poorly differentiation, presence of vascular invasion and advanced TNM stage. Furthermore, gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that SNHG17 promoted cell proliferation, migration and inhibited apoptosis of HCC. By employing RNA sequencing, we found knockdown of SNHG17 caused 1037 differentially expressed genes, highly enriched in several pathways, including metabolic, PI3K-Akt, cell adhesion, regulation of cell proliferation and apoptotic pathway, among them 92 were overlapped with SNHG17-related genes in TCGA-LIHC dataset. Furthermore, ERH, TBCA, TDO2 and PDK4 were successfully validated and found significantly dysregulated in HCC tissues. Moreover, HCC patients with higher SNHG17 expression had a relatively poor overall survival and disease-free survival and ERH, PDK4 also played markedly role in prognosis of HCC. Broadly, our findings illustrate that SNHG17 acts as a noncoding oncogene in HCC progression, suggesting its potential value as a novel target for HCC therapy.

The role of CHD5 in metastasis is unknown. We confirm that low expression of CHD5 is associated with stage 4 NB. Forced expression of CHD5 in NB cell lines with 1p loss inhibited key aspects of the metastatic cascade in vitro: anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion. In vivo, formation of bone marrow and liver metastases developing from intravenously injected NB cells was delayed and decreased by forced CHD5 expression. Genome-wide mRNA sequencing revealed reduction of genes and gene sets associated with metastasis when CHD5 was overexpressed. Known metastasis-suppressing genes preferentially up-regulated in CHD5-overexpressing NB cells included PLCL1. In patient NB, low expression of PLCL1 was associated with metastatic disease and poor survival. Knock-down of PLCL1 and of p53 in IMR5 NB cells overexpressing CHD5 reversed CHD5-induced inhibition of invasion and migration in vitro. In summary, CHD5 is a metastasis suppressor in NB.

Exposure to high lipids is proposed to both protect and damage beta-cells under different circumstances. By feeding mice high fat diet (HFD) for 2 weeks up to 14 months, we showed that HFD initially causes the beta-cells to expand in population whereas long-term exposure to HFD is associated with failure of beta-cells and the inability of animals to respond to glucose challenge. To prevent the failure of beta-cells and the development of T2D, we explored the molecular mechanisms that underlie this biphasic response of beta-cells to lipid exposure. Using palmitic acid (PA) in cultured beta-cells and islets, we demonstrated that chronic exposure to lipids leads to reduced viability and inhibition of cell cycle progression concurrent with downregulation of a pro-growth/survival kinase AKT, independent of glucose. To explore the mechanism further, we performed RNA-seq analysis in WT and AKT1-/- mice fed HFD for 4 months. The data here is the results of this study.

Microarray analysis was carried out on human GBM primary cells (GBM 10181360) and GBM cell line (U87) exposed to P-bi-TAT (10-6 M tetrac equivalent) for 24 h and 48 h. P-bi-TAT significantly downregulated electron transport chain genes ATP5A1 (ATP synthase A1), ATP51, ATP5G2, COX6B1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B1), NDUFA8 (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] FA8), NDUFV2 and other NDUF genes, SLC25A6 (solute carrier group 2), UCP2 ([mitochondrial] uncoupling protein 2) and COX5A. The NDUF and ATP genes are also relevant to control of oxidative phosphorylation and transcription. Six additional NDUF genes linked to oxidative phosphorylation were affected. Conclusions. P-bi-TAT caused downregulation of expression of a panel of genes involved in electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and cytoplasmic ribosomal protein generation in GBM cells.

Our genome-wide microarray screens demonstrated that fb-PMT appears to exert its potent anticancer actions on human cancer cells through the molecular interference mechanism with multiple signaling pathways supporting growth and survival of leukemic cells. Notably, fb-PMT had a significant effect on different molecular pathways that contribute to the anticancer activity such as cell cycle control (MYC), survival and maintenance of stem cells (HIF1A; TFAP2C), essential features of the malignant phenotype (TWIST1; SNAI). Furthermore, the fb-PMT-induced significant transcriptional pathway’s activation includes RB1; IRF9; MAML1; RAP1A; and GATA4 pathways, which known to play an important role in anticancer activity. Finally, Consistent with our previous reports on the crosstalk between integrin αvβ3 and ERα which contributes to the induced proliferation of cancer cells, we found that fb-PMT interference with estrogen signaling.

Thus, the aim of this work is to develop a network-based approach to investigate molecular pathways driving progression from eCLD to ACLF. We created 9 liver-specific biological networks capturing key pathophysiological processes potentially related to CLD. We used these networks as framework to perform gene set enrichment analyses(GSEA) and create dynamic profiles of disease progression. RESULTS: Principal component analyses revealed that samples clustered according to the disease stage. GSEA analyses of the defined processes showed an up-regulation of inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis networks throughout disease progression. Interestingly, we did not find significant gene expression differences between CC and DC, while ACLF showed acute expression changes in all the defined liver-related networks. The analyses of disease progression patterns identified ascending and descending expression profiles associated to ACLF onset. Functional analyses showed that ascending profiles were associated to inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, senescence and carcinogenesis networks, while descending profiles were mainly related to oxidative stress and genetic factors. We confirmed by qPCR the up-regulation of 4 genes of the ascending profile CXCL-6, KRT-18, SPINK-1, and ITGA2, and validated our findings on an independent patient’s cohort. CONCLUSION: ACLF is characterized by a specific hepatic gene expression pattern related to inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, senescence and carcinogenesis processes. Moreover, the observed profile is significantly different from that of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, supporting thus the hypothesis that ACLF should be considered a distinct entity.

Portal hypertension is the main consequence of cirrhosis, responsible for the complications defining clinical decompensation. The only cure for decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation, but it is a limited resource and opens the possibility of regenerative therapy. We investigated the potential of human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stromal (hAMSCs) and epithelial (hAECs) stem cells for the treatment of portal hypertension and chronic liver disease. Methods. In vivo: hAMSCs and hAECs were isolated from human amniotic membranes. Cirrhotic rats with ascites (chronic CCl4 inhalation) received 4x10e6 hAMSCs, 4x10e6 hAECs, or vehicle (NaCl 0.9%) (intraperitoneal; n=10 per group). After 2-week we analyzed: a) portal pressure (PP) and liver microcirculatory function; b) liver sinusoidal endothelial (LSECs) and hepatic stellate (HSCs) cells phenotype; c) hepatic fibrosis, inflammation and hepatic function. In vitro: HSCs isolated from CCl4-cirrhotic rats were co-cultured with hAMSCs, hAECs or vehicle for 24h. RNA profile was analyzed by RNAseq. Results. Cirrhotic rats receiving hAMSCs or hAECs had significantly lower PP than vehicle-treated animals, together with improved liver microcirculatory function. This hemodynamic amelioration was associated with improvement in LSECs capillarization and HSCs de-activation, although hepatic collagen/fibrosis was not significantly reduced. Rats that received placenta derived stem cells had markedly reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress. Finally, liver function tests significantly improved in rats receiving hAMSCs. In vitro experiments confirmed HSCs de-activation when co-cultured with stem cells. Conclusion. This pre-clinical study shows that infusion of human amniotic stem cells effectively decreases PP by ameliorating liver microcirculation, suggesting that it may represent a new treatment option for advanced cirrhosis with portal hypertension.

GSE183790	2021.09.10	Homo sapiens	GPL570	TRUE	TRUE	6	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Negative Feedback Regulation of Cholesterol Biosynthesis by MMAB	Intricate regulatory networks govern the net balance of cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake and efflux; however, the mechanisms surrounding cholesterol homeostasis remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop an integrative genomic strategy to detect regulators of LDLR activity and identify 250 genes whose knockdown affects LDL-cholesterol uptake and whose expression is modulated by intracellular cholesterol levels in human hepatic cells. From these hits, we focus on MMAB, an enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of vitamin B12 to adenosylcobalamin, and whose expression has previously been linked with altered levels of circulating cholesterol in humans. We demonstrate that hepatic levels of MMAB are modulated by dietary and cellular cholesterol levels through SREBP2, the master transcriptional regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. Knockdown of MMAB decreases intracellular cholesterol levels and augments SREBP2-mediated gene expression and LDL-cholesterol uptake in human and mouse hepatic cell lines. Reductions in total sterol content were attributed to increased intracellular levels of propionic and methylmalonic acid and subsequent inhibition of HMGCR activity and cholesterol biosynthesis. Moreover, mice treated with antisense inhibitors of MMAB display a significant reduction in hepatic HMGCR activity, hepatic sterol content and increased expression of SREBP2-mediated genes. Collectively, these findings reveal an unexpected role for the adenosylcobalamin pathway in regulating LDLR expression and identify MMAB as an additional control point by which cholesterol biosynthesis is regulated by its end product.		statin;LDL;Human hepatic cell line (Huh7 cells);control;Huh7

Growing evidences have showed lncRNAs are widely expressed and take part in the genesis and development of many diseases, including tuberculosis. Therefore, to screen the differential lncRNAs among MDR-TB, drug-sensitive tuberculosis(DS-TB) and healthy controls(HCs) is a good strategy to acquire potential biomarkers for MDR-TB diagnosis and partly describe the mechanism of MDR-TB.

Deep immune profiling showed acute MIS-C patients had highly activated neutrophils, classical monocytes and memory CD8+ T-cells; increased frequencies of B-cell plasmablasts and double-negative B-cells. Post treatment samples from the same patients, taken when symptoms were resolving, identified recovery-associated immune features including CD163+ monocytes, emergence of a new population of immature neutrophils and, in some patients, a transient increase in arginase. Plasma profiling identified multiple features shared by MIS-C, Kawasaki Disease and COVID-19 and that therapeutic inhibition of IL6 may be preferable to IL1 or TNF-a. We identified potential new mechanisms of action for IVIG, the most commonly used drug to treat MIS-C. Finally, we showed systemic complement activation with high plasma C5b-9 levels is common in MIS-C, suggesting complement inhibitors could be used to treat the disease.

Post-transcriptional regulation of Pten heavily relies on regulatory elements encoded by its 3’UTR. We previously reported the important diversity of 3’UTR isoforms of Pten mRNAs produced through alternative polyadenylation (APA). Here, we reveal the direct regulation of Pten APA by the mammalian cleavage factor I (CFIm) complex, which in turn contributes to PTEN protein dosage. CFIm consists of the UGUA-binding CFIm25 and APA regulatory subunits CFIm59 or CFIm68. Deep sequencing analyses of perturbed (KO and KD) cell lines uncovered the differential regulation of Pten APA by CFIm59 and CFIm68 and further revealed that their divergent functions have widespread impact for APA in transcriptomes. Differentially regulated genes include numerous factors within the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signalling pathway that PTEN counter-regulates. We further reveal a stratification of APA dysregulation among a subset of PTEN-driven cancers, with recurrent alterations among PI3K/Akt pathway genes regulated by CFIm. Our results refine the transcriptome selectivity of the CFIm complex in APA regulation, and the breadth of its impact in PTEN-driven cancers.

While T lymphocytes metabolically adapt to microenvironmental changes, knowledge of human ILC2 metabolism is limited and its key regulators are unknown. Here we show that circulating “naïve” ILC2 have an unexpected metabolic profile with a higher level of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) than NK cells. Accordingly, ILC2 are severely reduced in patients with mitochondrial disease and impaired OXPHOS. Metabolomic and nutrient receptors analysis reveals ILC2 uptake amino acids to sustain OXPHOS at steady-state. Upon activation with interleukin 33 (IL-33), ILC2 become highly proliferative relying on glycolysis and mTOR to produce IL-13, while continuing to fuel OXPHOS with amino acids to maintain cellular fitness and proliferation. Our results suggest that proliferation and function are metabolically uncoupled in human ILC2, offering new strategies to target ILC2 in disease settings.

Alcohol (EtOH) intoxication disrupts circadian rhythms within liver, brain, and intestines, but it is unknown whether alcohol also disrupts components of the core clock in skeletal muscle. Female C57BL/6Hsd mice were randomized to receive either saline (control) or alcohol (EtOH) (5g/kg) via intraperitoneal injection at the start of the dark cycle (ZT12), and gastrocnemius was collected every 4hr from Control and EtOH treated mice for the next 48hr following isoflurane anesthetization. In addition, metyrapone was administered prior to alcohol intoxication in separate mice to determine whether the alcohol-induced increase in serum corticosterone contributed to circadian gene regulation. Finally, synchronized C2C12 myotubes were treated with alcohol (100mM) to assess the influence of centrally or peripherally mediated effects of alcohol on the muscle clock. Alcohol significantly disrupted the mRNA expression of Bmal1, Per1/2, and Cry1/2 in addition to perturbing the clock-controlled genes, Myod1, Dbp, Tef, and Bhlhe40 (p<0.05). Alcohol increased serum corticosterone levels and glucocorticoid target genes, Redd1 and Klf15, in muscle. Metyrapone decreased serum corticosterone in EtOH mice but did not normalize the mRNA expression of Per1, Cry1 and Cry2 and Myod1 which were altered by EtOH. Alcohol did not alter core clock gene expression (Bmal, Per1/2, Cry1/2) at 4, 8, and 12hrs post treatment in synchronized C2C12 myotubes. Therefore, binge alcohol disrupted genes of the core molecular clock independently of elevated serum corticosterone.		gastrocnemius and plantaris muscle;Saline control;EtOH;C57BL/6;male
GSE183561	2021.09.10	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	18	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Male biased islet b cell dysfunction is caused by the MODY MAFA S64F variant by inducing premature aging and senescence	A heterozygous missense mutation producing a variant of the islet β-cell-enriched MAFA transcription factor (p.Ser64Phe (S64F)) was identified in patients who developed adult-onset, β-cell dysfunction (diabetes or insulinomatosis), with men more prone to diabetes than women. This mutation engenders increased stability to the normally unstable MAFA protein. To obtain insight into how this variant impacts β cell function, we developed a mouse model expressing S64F MafA and found sex-dependent phenotypes, with heterozygous mutant males (MafAS64F/+) displaying impaired glucose tolerance while females were slightly hypoglycemic with improved blood glucose clearance. Only MafAS64F/+ males showed transiently higher MafA protein levels preceding the onset of glucose intolerance and sex-dependent, differential expression of genes involved in Ca2+ signaling, DNA damage, aging, and senescence. Functional changes in islet Ca2+ handling and signs of islet aging and senescence processes were uniquely observed in male animals. In addition, MAFAS64F production in male human β cells accelerated cellular senescence and increased production of senescence-associated secretory proteins compared to cells expressing MAFAWT. Together, these results implicate a conserved mechanism of accelerated islet aging and senescence in promoting diabetes in MAFAS64F carriers in a sex-dependent manner.

Hence, there is an unmet need to identify factors which can reverse this dysfunctional profile and restore their anti-tumorigenic potential. Activin-A is a pleiotropic cytokine, exerting a broad range of pro- or anti-inflammatory functions in different disease contexts, including allergic and autoimmune disorders and cancer. Given that activin-A exhibits a profound effect on CD4+ T cells in the airways and is elevated in lung cancer patients, we hypothesized that activin-A can effectively regulate anti-tumor immunity in lung cancer. Methods: To evaluate the effects of activin-A in the context of lung cancer, we utilized the OVA-expressing Lewis Lung Carcinoma mouse model as well as the B16F10 melanoma model of pulmonary metastases. The therapeutic potential of activin-A-treated lung tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells was evaluated in adoptive transfer experiments, using CD4-/--tumor bearing mice as recipients. In a reverse approach, we disrupted activin-A signaling on CD4+ T cells using an inducible model of CD4+ T cell-specific knockout of activin-A type I receptor. RNA-Sequencing analysis was performed to assess the transcriptional signature of these cells and the molecular mechanisms which mediate activin-A’s function. In a translational approach, we validated activin-A’s anti-tumorigenic properties using primary human tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells from lung cancer patients. Results: Administration of activin-A in lung tumor-bearing mice attenuated disease progression, an effect associated with heightened ratio of infiltrating effector to regulatory CD4+ T cells. Therapeutic transfer of lung tumor-infiltrating activin-A-treated CD4+ T cells, delayed tumor progression in CD4-/- recipients and enhanced T cell-mediated immunity. CD4+ T cells genetically unresponsive to activin-A, failed to elicit effective anti-tumor properties and displayed an exhausted molecular signature governed by the transcription factors Tox and Tox2. Of translational importance, treatment of activin-A on tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells from lung cancer patients augmented their immunostimulatory capacity towards autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Conclusions: In this study, we introduce activin-A as a novel immunomodulatory factor in the lung tumor microenvironment, which bestows exhausted CD4+ T cells with effector properties.

We demonstrate that CasMINI can drive high levels of gene activation (up to thousands-fold increases), while the natural Cas12f system fails to function in mammalian cells. We show that the CasMINI system has comparable activities to Cas12a for gene activation, is highly specific, and allows for robust base editing and gene editing.

How to improve therapeutic options for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) is the core question for CRC treatment. However, the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC is not fully understood, and its influence on response to chemotherapy is unclear. Here we provide an in-depth analysis of transcriptional landscape of primary CRC, matched liver metastases and blood at single-cell resolution, and perform a systematic examination of transcriptional changes and phenotypic alteration of the TME in response to preoperative chemotherapy (PC). Based on 111,292 single-cell transcriptomes, our study reveals that TME of treatment-naïve tumors is characterized by higher abundance of less-activated B cells and higher heterogeneity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). By contrast, in tumors treated with PC, we find activation of B cells, lower diversity of TAMs with immature and less activated phenotype, lower abundance of both dysfunctional T cells and ECM-remodeling cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and an accumulation of myofibroblasts. Our study provides a foundation for future investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying liver metastasis of CRC and its response to PC, and opens up new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies for CRC.		treated;primary colorectal cancer;IVA;treatment-naïve;Male;Female;the tumor microenvironment of liver metastases of CRC;PBMC;matched liver metastases

Here, we identify critical roles for the scavenger receptor MARCO in controlling viremia during arthritogenic alphavirus infections in mice. Following subcutaneous inoculation, alphavirus particles drain via the lymph and are rapidly captured by MARCO+ lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in the draining lymph node (dLN), limiting viral spread to the bloodstream. Upon reaching the bloodstream, MARCO-expressing Kupffer cells in the liver remove circulating alphavirus particles, limiting viremia and further viral dissemination. MARCO-mediated accumulation of alphavirus particles in the lymph node and liver has important implications as viremia and viral tissue burdens are elevated in MARCO-/- mice and disease outcomes are more severe. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized pathogen scavenging role for LECs and improve our mechanistic understanding of viremia control during arboviral infections.

However, only half of treated patients respond and almost all patients that initially respond eventually relapse. We performed an optimized loss-of-function shRNA screen in combination with azacitidine treatment in an MDS-derived acute myeloid leukemia cell line to identify chromatin regulators affecting drug response. We identified CBP, as a major regulator of azacitidine sensitivity. Compounds inhibiting the enzymatic activity of CBP synergistically reduced viability of MDS-derived AML cell lines when combined with AZA. Surprisingly, this effect was specific for the RNA-dependent functions of AZA and not observed with the related compound decitabine that is limited to DNA incorporation. The identification of immediate target genes suggested that the effect of CBP inhibition is mediated by downregulation of genes encoding the translational machinery, which could be confirmed in proteomic analysis of nascent proteins. Furthermore, proteins most affected by CBP inhibition include key drivers of cell cycle progression.		acute myeloid leukemia;DMSO;4su labeling for 60 min before harvest:;C646;MOLM-13;MOLM-13 cells

Methods: CD14+ monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of lcSSc (n=5, age=54.4±6.7), dcSSc patients (n=5, age=51.8±7.2) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) (n=5, age=50.8±9.7). Total RNA was isolated and polyA libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit. Next Generation Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. Differentially expressed genes were computed using DESeq2 algorithm. Results: We detected 1440 differentially expressed genes between dcSSc vs HC and 225 between lcSSc and HC respectively (p≤0.01; log2 ratio≥0.5, Fig 1). Among those, in dcSSc 1076 were upregulated (e.g. MMP9, IL1R2, FLT3, MIF, TLR9) and 364 were downregulated (e.g. TGFBR1, CD44, CD244, HLA-DRA, HLA-G). In lcSSc 160 transcripts were upregulated (e.g. CCL2, WNT5B, MMP17) and 65 were downregulated (e.g. KLF11, IRAK2). We identified 123 commonly deregulated genes between SSc subgroups (e.g. CCL3, CD14, IL27, MMP17). Principal component analysis showed close clustering within SSc subgroups and clear separation from healthy controls. Pathway analysis revealed alterations in several biological processes important in fibrogenesis including antigen presentation, MIF-induced immune responses, TGF-β, NOTCH and WNT signalling pathways. qPCR analysis further confirmed differences in gene expression on mRNA level (n HC=8, n SSc=25, p≤0.05). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first global transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes in SSc. Our results suggest a primary activation of monocytes in peripheral blood, which might be further translated into novel cellular biomarker of the disease and potentially used for distinguishing between responders and non-responders to a novel treatment in future clinical trials.

Here, we demonstrate the ability of the anti-CD137 agonist urelumab for overcoming TGF-β-mediated inhibition of human NK-cell proliferation and sustained anti-tumor function. Transcriptomic, immunophenotypic and functional analyses evidenced that CD137 costimulation modified the transcriptional program induced by TGF-β on activated NK cells by limiting SMAD4-dependent inhibition of pro-proliferative (CD25, cMyc), activating (NKG2D, CD16) and effector (Granzyme B, IFNγ) molecules while maintaining SMAD4-independent acquisition of tumor-retention features (CXCR3, CD103). Activated NK cells cultured in the presence of TGF-β1 and CD137 agonist showed preserved antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against cancer cells, recovered CCL5 and IFNγ secretion and gained the capacity for producing IL-9 upon restimulation. Treatment of breast tumor-derived multicellular cultures with trastuzumab and urelumab recapitulated CD137 induction and fostered tumor-infiltrating CD16+ NK cell persistence.

Here, we demonstrate the ability of the anti-CD137 agonist urelumab for overcoming TGF-β-mediated inhibition of human NK-cell proliferation and sustained anti-tumor function. Transcriptomic, immunophenotypic and functional analyses evidenced that CD137 costimulation modified the transcriptional program induced by TGF-β on activated NK cells by limiting SMAD4-dependent inhibition of pro-proliferative (CD25, cMyc), activating (NKG2D, CD16) and effector (Granzyme B, IFNγ) molecules while maintaining SMAD4-independent acquisition of tumor-retention features (CXCR3, CD103). Activated NK cells cultured in the presence of TGF-β1 and CD137 agonist showed preserved antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against cancer cells, recovered CCL5 and IFNγ secretion and gained the capacity for producing IL-9 upon restimulation. Treatment of breast tumor-derived multicellular cultures with trastuzumab and urelumab recapitulated CD137 induction and fostered tumor-infiltrating CD16+ NK cell persistence.

To get more insight into when and where TSHZ3 is required for the proper development of the brain, we generated and characterized a novel mouse model of conditional Tshz3 deletion in projection neurons from postnatal day 2-3 onward. These mice exhibit altered cortical expression of genes encoding for synaptic components, electrophysiological and synaptic changes in layer 5 CPNs, impaired corticostriatal glutamate transmission and plasticity, as well as strong ASD-relevant behavioral deficits. These data, by revealing a crucial postnatal role of TSHZ3 in the development and function of the corticostriatal circuitry that might be determinant for ASD pathogenesis, offer a novel ASD model and further open the possibility for an early postnatal therapeutic window for the syndrome linked to TSHZ3 haploinsufficiency.		mouse cerebral cortex;Tshz3 mutant;wild type;Postnatal day 34 (P34)

Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) express large amounts of major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) molecules. Despite this long-appreciated observation, the function of epithelial MHCII-mediated signaling on gut homeostasis remains enigmatic. As IECs serve as the primary cellular barrier between intestinal microbes and underlying host immune cells, we reasoned that IEC-intrinsic antigen presentation may play a role in tolerogenic responses towards the microbiota.

A striking difference observed in the absence of IEC-MHCII is that while transcription of MHCII is similar, underlying mononuclear phagocytes had reduced surface MHCII.

Here we show that repeated daily five-minute restraint resolves pre-existing stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Repeated injection of glucocorticoids in low doses mimics the anti-depressive effects of short-term stress. Repeated exposure to short-term stress and injection of glucocorticoids activate neurons in largely overlapping regions of the brain, as shown by c-Fos staining, and reverse distinct stress-induced gene expression profiles. Chemogenetic inhibition of neurons in the prelimbic cortex projecting to the nucleus accumbens, basolateral amygdala, or bed nucleus of the stria terminalis results in anti-depressive effects similarly to short-term stress exposure, while only inhibition of neurons in the prelimbic cortex projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis rescues glucocorticoid release. In summary, we show that short-term stress can reverse adaptively altered stress gains and resolve stress-induced depressive-like behavior.		3 months;Chronic restraint stress 2 h for 14 days and then chronic short-term restraint stress for 5 min for 14 days;Prelimbic cortex;Chronic restraint stress 2 h for 14 days;brain;Naïve control;male;C57BL/6

However, the complex mechanisms regulating tumor immunogenicity have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether Transcription factor sine oculis homeobox 1 (SIX1) expression in the cancer cells regulated anti-tumor immunity by reshaping TME. Methods: The expression of SIX1 in human tumor tissues was analyzed based on TCGA data. Six1 knockout murine cell lines were generated to analyze the SIX1-associated tumor progression and anti-tumor immune response in tumor xenograft models. Immune cells and cytokines in TME were quantified by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and ELISPOT assay. SIX1-associated differentially expressed genes were investigated in cancer cells and tissues with RNA-Seq. At the end, Correlation of SIX1 with TGFBR2 expression was assessed by Western blot and Dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results:SIX1 was highly upregulated in human tumor tissues, while rarely expressed in matched normal tissues. Deletion of the Six1 in cancer cells inhibited tumor growth, depending on adaptive immunity. Moreover, Six1 deficiency significantly enhanced CD8+ T cells infiltration, leading to eradication of poorly immunogenic tumors and maintaining a long-term protection from tumor re-challenge. Mechanistically, SIX1 as a transcription factor upregulated TGFBR2 expression, which induced collagen genes expression via the Smad2/3 phosphorylation, increased collagens deposition in TME and hampered CD8+ T cells infiltration. Conclusions: Six1 deletion in cancer cells improved tumor immunogenicity, leading to tumor destruction by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. Our observations uncovered a crucial role of SIX1 on remodulating tumor immunogenicity and demonstrated a proof of concept for targeting SIX1 in cancer immunotherapy.		tumor tissue;Six1-/-;wild type;mouse fibrosarcoma MCA205 cells;cell line;C57BL/6

However, the implications of heterogeneity in TF expression across islet cell populations are not well understood. To define this TF heterogeneity and its consequences for cellular function, we profiled >40,000 cells from normal human islets by scRNA-seq and stratified α and β cells based on combinatorial TF expression. Subpopulations of islet cells co-expressing ARX/MAFB (α cells) and MAFA/MAFB (β cells) exhibited greater expression of key genes related to glucose sensing and hormone secretion relative to subpopulations expressing only one or neither TF. Moreover, all subpopulations were identified in native pancreatic tissue from multiple donors. By Patch-seq, MAFA/MAFB co-expressing β cells showed enhanced electrophysiological activity. Thus, these results indicate combinatorial TF expression in islet α and β cells predicts highly functional, mature subpopulations.

Two breast cancer cell lines with different levels of glycolytic activity, MDA-MB-231 of a claudin low-type breast cancer cell and MCF7 of luminal type breast cancer cell, were selected and co-cultured, as the originating and recipient cells using indirect co-culture system such as transwell system or microfluidic system. Proteomic profiling of the co-cultured MCF7 cells revealed proliferation and dedifferentiation of the MCF7 cells following co-culture with the MDA-MB-231 cells. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that glycolysis increased in the co-cultured MCF7 cells, and the component analysis of glycolysis-related genes revealed that the second-most component after cytoplasm was extracellular exosomes. In addition, 36 significant KEGG pathways were identified in a total of 856 proteins identified by proteomin analysis of MDA-MB-231-induced EVs. Among these pathways were the main pathways (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways) that could explain the metabolic modulation of MCF7 cells. In our work, we indirectly show that it is MDA-MB-231-derived EVs that play an important role in this phenomenon.

Purpose: The goals of this study is to identify molecular pathways and genes that are involved in the treatment responsiveness of breast cancer PDOs. Methods: mRNA profiles of HCI-001 and HCI-002 PDOs were generated by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform for paired-end sequencing, 150-bp read length, for about 20 million raw reads per sample. RNA sequencing FASTQ files were processed with HISAT2 aligner in default mode with the Ensembl human transcriptome annotation (Build version GRCh38 and transcript annotation GRCh38.89). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 software. Enrichment analysis was performed using ClusterProfiler software. Results: We mapped about 20 million sequence reads per sample to the human genome (build HG38) in the RNAs of HCI-001 and HCI-002 PDOs treated with paclitaxel or vehicle. We used a minimum expression cut-off of 1 FPKM in order to exclude low-levels genes and the RNA-seq data confirmed the difference expression of 67 known apoptosis-regulatory genes in treatment-sensitive PDOs (HCI-002) compare to treatment-resistant PDOs (HCI-001).

Among thirty-seven patients enrolled, the overall response rate, composite complete remission rate (CRc; primary endpoint), and median overall survival (OS) were 46%, 38% and 11.1 months, respectively. Patients with refractory/early relapse and those receiving treatment as first salvage had encouraging outcomes (median OS 13.2 and 11.3 months, respectively). Grade >3 immune-related adverse events were rare (14%) and self-limiting. Patients who achieved CRc had a higher frequency of progenitor exhausted CD8+ T-cells in the bone marrow prior to treatment and a non-significant increase in baseline T-cell diversity.

GSE181471	2021.09.09	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	8	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE	GSE168027		Enhancer reactivation mediates adaptive resistance to FGFR inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer [PDX_RNA_seq]	A subset of triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are characterized by genetic alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) including amplifications, activating mutations or gene fusions. However, despite this genetic evidence of FGFR-dependency, FGFR inhibitors have shown only limited clinical efficacy in TNBC, suggesting the presence of intrinsic or adaptive resistance mechanisms. Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we found that resistance to FGFR inhibition is mediated by activation of the mTORC1 and YAP pathways. Prolonged FGFR inhibition increased expression of several amino acid transporters resulting in increased cellular level of certain amino acids and activation of the mTORC1 amino acid sensing pathway. Epigenomic analyses revealed that FGFR inhibition reorganized YAP/TEAD associated enhancers leading to the upregulation of YAP target genes including the amino acid transporters upstream of mTORC1. Remarkably, mTORC1 and FGFR inhibitors synergistically blocked the growth of TNBC cells in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts. These findings define a novel epigenetic feedback mechanism involving intracellular amino acid levels leading to targeted therapy resistance in TNBC, and offers a combinatorial drug treatment strategy to improve clinical outcomes for this aggressive breast cancer subtype.		breast cancer cells;Patient-derived xenografts tumors;breast cancer;infigratinib;vehicle

Using the C. rodentium carrier model of germfree mice (GF), we found that colonization of adult GF with 14 selected commensals (OMM12+MC2) was sufficient to convert a carriers into responders through maturation of intestinal crypts, increasing intestinal angiogenesis and stimulation of the immune system. While the immature colon of C. rodentium infected GF did not allow sufficient extravasation of neutrophils into the gut lumen, colonization with these commensals triggered activation and proliferation of endothelial cells, enabling granulocytes to transmigrate into the gut lumen. Enhanced angiogenesis and morphological maturation development of the intestine was most likely due to sensing of commensals by Paneth cells and subsequent secretion of antimicrobial peptides and angiogenetic factors. This demonstrates the therapeutic value of few commensal bacteria to complete morphological and immunological maturation in of the adult intestinal mucosa enabling rendering this organ immunocompetent against infections and responsive to therapies.		germfree mice;germ-free;conventional;specific-pathogen-free;endothelial cell;colon;Colon sorted endothelial cells;C57BL/6

Cellular proliferation is spatiotemporally regulated in developing vessel networks but how this is achieved and differentially controlled in specific lineages is unknown. Using a zebrafish forward genetic screen for mutants that form blood vessels but fail to form lymphatic vessels, we uncovered a mutant for the RNA helicase Ddx21. Ddx21 cell-autonomously regulates the early development of lymphatic endothelial cells. Ddx21 is essential for Vegfc-Vegfr3 driven endothelial cell proliferation. Ddx21 is an established regulator of ribosomal RNA transcription and in the absence of Ddx21, mutant lymphatic endothelial cells show reduced ribosome biogenesis. Ultimately, loss of Ddx21 leads to a p53-p21 dependent cell cycle arrest that blocks embryonic lymphangiogenesis. Thus, the RNA helicase Ddx21 coordinates the endothelial cell proliferative response to Vegfc-Vegfr3 signalling by balancing ribosome biogenesis and p53-p21 signalling.

However, dysregulated anti-pathogen immune responses can provoke life-threatening inflammatory pathologies collectively known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), exemplified by key clinical phenotypes unearthed during the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. The underlying pathophysiology of CRS remains elusive. We found that FLIP, a protein that controls caspase-8 death pathways, was highly expressed in myeloid cells of COVID-19 lungs. FLIP controlled CRS by fueling a STAT3-dependent inflammatory program. Indeed, constitutive expression of a viral FLIP homologue in myeloid cells triggered a STAT3-linked, progressive and fatal inflammatory syndrome in mice, characterized by elevated cytokine output, lymphopenia, lung injury and multiple organ dysfunctions that mimicked human CRS. As STAT3-targeting approaches relieved inflammation, immune disorders, and organ failures in these mice, targeted intervention towards this pathway could suppress the lethal CRS inflammatory state.

However, despite this genetic evidence of FGFR-dependency, FGFR inhibitors have shown only limited clinical efficacy in TNBC, suggesting the presence of intrinsic or adaptive resistance mechanisms. Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we found that resistance to FGFR inhibition is mediated by activation of the mTORC1 and YAP pathways. Prolonged FGFR inhibition increased expression of several amino acid transporters resulting in increased cellular level of certain amino acids and activation of the mTORC1 amino acid sensing pathway. Epigenomic analyses revealed that FGFR inhibition reorganized YAP/TEAD associated enhancers leading to the upregulation of YAP target genes including the amino acid transporters upstream of mTORC1. Remarkably, mTORC1 and FGFR inhibitors synergistically blocked the growth of TNBC cells in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts. These findings define a novel epigenetic feedback mechanism involving intracellular amino acid levels leading to targeted therapy resistance in TNBC, and offers a combinatorial drug treatment strategy to improve clinical outcomes for this aggressive breast cancer subtype.

However, the global localization and the general chromatin-binding ability of RBPs are not well-characterized and remain undefined in hematopoietic cells. Results: We first provide a full view of RBPs' distribution pattern in the nucleus and screen for chromatin-enriched RBPs (Che-RBPs) in different human cells. Subsequently, by generating ChIP-seq, CLIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets and conducting combined analysis, the transcriptional regulatory potential of certain hematopoietic Che-RBPs are predicted. From this analysis, quaking (QKI5) emerges as a potential transcriptional activator during monocytic differentiation. QKI5 is over-represented in gene promoter regions, independent of RNA or transcription factors. Furthermore, DNA-bound QKI5 activates the transcription of several critical monocytic differentiation-associated genes, including CXCL2, IL16 and PTPN6. Finally, we show that the differentiation promoting activity of QKI5 is largely dependent on CXCL2, irrespective of its RNA binding capacity. Conclusions: Our study indicates that Che-RBPs are versatile factors that orchestrate gene expression in different cellular contexts, and identifies QKI5, a classic RBP regulating RNA processing, as a novel transcriptional activator during monocytic differentiation.

PUM1&2 function to negatively regulate gene expression by accelerating degradation of specific mRNAs. Here, we determined the repression mechanism and impact of human PUM1&2 on the transcriptome. We identified subunits of the CCR4-NOT (CNOT) deadenylase complex required for stable interaction with PUM1&2 and to elicit CNOT-dependent repression. Isoform-level RNA sequencing revealed broad co-regulation of target mRNAs through the PUM-CNOT repression mechanism. Functional dissection of the domains of PUM1&2 identified a conserved N-terminal region that confers the predominant repressive activity via direct interaction with CNOT. In addition, we show that the DCP2 mRNA decapping enzyme has an important role in repression by PUM1&2 N-terminal regions. Our results support a molecular model of repression by human PUM1&2 via direct recruitment of CNOT deadenylation machinery in a decapping-dependent pathway.

Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key transcription regulator that tightly controls organ size including that of liver. Ours and other previous studies suggested increased nuclear localization and activation of YAP after TCPOBOP treatment in mice and potential role of YAP in CAR-driven proliferative response. Here, we investigated a direct role of YAP in CAR-driven hepatomegaly and hepatocyte proliferation using hepatocyte-specific YAP-KO mice. AAV8-TBG-CRE vector was injected to YAP-floxed mice for achieving hepatocyte-specific YAP deletion followed by TCPOBOP treatment. YAP deletion did not alter protein expression of CAR or CAR-driven induction of drug metabolism genes (including Cyp2b10, Cyp2c55 and UGT1a1). However, YAP deletion substantially reduced TCPOBOP-induced hepatocyte proliferation. TCPOBOP-driven cell cycle activation was disrupted in YAP-KO mice due to delayed (and decreased) induction of cyclin D1 and higher expression of p21, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Further, induction of other cyclins, which are sequentially involved in progression through cell cycle (including cyclin E1, A2 and B1) and important mitotic regulators (such as aurora B kinase and polo-like kinase 1) was remarkably reduced in YAP-KO mice. Microarray analysis revealed that 26% of TCPOBOP‐responsive genes mainly related to proliferation, but not to drug metabolism, were altered by YAP deletion. YAP regulated these proliferation genes via alerting expression of cMyc and FOXM1, two critical transcriptional regulators of CAR-mediated hepatocyte proliferation. Conclusion: Our study revealed an important role of YAP signaling in CAR-driven hepatocyte proliferation; however, CAR-driven induction of drug metabolism genes was independent of YAP.

Here we report that IQGAP1, a cytosolic scaffold protein, localizes in the nucleus of gastric cancer cells acting as a tethering module for hnRNPM as well as other spliceosome components. The IQGAP1-hnRNPM interaction alters, among others, the alternative splicing of ANAPC10 and is required for the response of hnRNPM to heat-induced stress signals. Together, IQGAP1 and hnRNPM promote gastric cancer cell growth while their depletion leads to cell cycle arrest and halts tumour progression. We propose that IQGAP1 localizes in the nucleus and coordinates gastric tumour growth by recruiting, in response to stress-signals, spliceosome components that drive cell cycle progression.

Methods: Vitamin A deficient (VAD) mice were generated by feeding VAD diet to the pregnant C57/BL6 dams and their post-weaning offspring. Vitamin A sufficient (VAS) mice were fed with purified diet containing normal amount of VA. At weaning, mice were maintained on their respective diets and assigned to one of the four treatment groups (non-infected VAD, infected VAD, non-infected VAS and infected VAS) until the end of the experiments. For the infected groups, age-matched VAD or VAS mice were orally inoculated with C. rodentium. Mice during early (SI study) or peak (colon study) C. rodentium infection were euthanized in two separate studies. The SI study focused on SI and analyses were performed on samples collected 5 days post-infection. The colon study analyzed samples on post-infection day 10, the peak of C. rodentium infection. Total mRNA extracted from SI and colon were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Three to six biological replicates were sequenced in each group. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG), Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) were performed to characterize expression patterns and co-expression patterns. Results: a) differentially expression genes (DEGs) corresponding to VA effect were present in both the SI and colon. In SI, DEGs altered by VA were mainly involved in the retinoid metabolic pathway and immunity-related pathways. Novel target genes (e.g. Mbl2, Mmp9, Cxcl14, and Nr0b2) and cell types (based on Tuft cell and mast cell markers) under the regulation of VA were suggested by differential expression analysis coupled with the co-expression network analysis. In regard to the colon, VA demonstrated an overall suppressive effect on the cell division pathway. Finally, the comparison of co-expression modules between SI and colon indicated distinct regulatory networks in these two organs. b) In the SI, no Infection effect was detected during early infection, whereas in the colon, during peak of C. rodentium infection: 1) It has been shown that infection upregulated innate and adaptive immune functions, epithelial proliferation, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and reactive oxygen species production, as well as downregulated ion and water absorption. This helped to confirm the findings in previous studies, consolidating the knowledge-base about the host response to C. rodentium, 2) Pathways (e.g. neuron activity, smooth muscle contraction, vascular constriction, and developmental regulation) and additional ion transporters previously not known to be influenced by C. rodentium were suggested as potential mechanisms responsible for the diarrhea pathology and host response. 3) Retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling pathways appeared to be downregulated by infection, indicating that the malabsorption of micronutrients might be a danger signal for the host to switch from homeostasis to an anti-infection mode. c) In the SI, no Interaction (VA status × C. rodentium infection) effect was detected during early infection. In colon, 1329 genes corresponded to the Interaction effect. During the peak of C. rodentium infection, the sufficient stimulation of cell division, protein catabolism, apoptosis, transcription regulation, MHC class I, interferons, and cytokine signaling might be of key importance for the resistance of VAS mice. In addition, the proper maintenance of the proliferation, differentiation, migration, and activation of T cells and leukocytes during peak infection may also confer the VAS hosts with higher survival and clearance rate. On the other hand, our data suggested that the higher rate of lethal dehydration observed in infected VAD mice, may be attributed to the disrupted of HCO3- metabolism and an improperly high level of Cl- secretion. Conclusions: VA alters the gene expression profile in both SI and colon, whereas the Infection effect and the Interaction effect were only observed in colon during peak of C. rodentium infection, but not in the SI during early infection. Our studies suggest novel target genes and cell types under the regulation of VA in the SI, and indicate that the resistance of the VAS hosts may be attributed to the concordant control over ion/water absorption, immune functions, as well as the balance between epithelial hyperplasia and apoptosis.		8-10 week;SI;colon-whole tissue;colon;wild type;SI-whole tissue;C57BL/6

We aim to study the mechanism of EPRS in translational regulation of cardiac fibrosis and establish EPRS or its downstream target genes as potential anti-fibrosis therapeutic targets. The goals of this study are to use next generation sequencing (NGS)-derived fibroblast transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) and translatome profiling (polysome-seq) followed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) methods to identify the downstream effector genes that are preferentially regulated by EPRS at the transcriptional and translational levels. Results: Using a well established data analysis workflow from the Genomic Research Center from University of Rochester Medical Center,  we analyzed RNA-seq and polysome-seq data. We have identified novel Pro-rich (PRR) gene pathways that are preferentially regulated by EPRS via enhanced translation elongation at Pro-rich codons and antagonized by Halofuginone. Considering the translation active state in both light and heavy polysome fractions, we redefined the 4 groups by overlapping genes from heavy and light polysome associated transcripts compared to their total RNA expression change (p value <0.05 for differential expressed genes). 1371 genes were downregulated at translation (indicated by polysome-seq) and steady-state mRNA (indicated by RNA-seq) levels, and 775 genes were upregulated at both levels. There are a small number of genes whose gene regulation was changed in the opposite direction at the mRNA and translation levels. These observations indicate a coordinated regulatory effect between steady-state mRNA level and translation efficiency under the EPRS inhibitory condition. KEGG analysis of the genes that are reduced at RNA and translation levels revealed multiple pro-fibrotic pathways, including ECM-receptor interaction and proteoglycans. In contrast, the genes that are induced at RNA and translation levels are enriched in general translation factors, including ribosome and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, which suggests a compensatory amino acid starvation response upon EPRS inhibition. Altered expression of typical Pro-rich collagen and other genes was confirmed with qRT-PCR.  Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of fibroblast translatome in comparison with transcriptome under EPRS inhibitory condition (halofuginone treatment), with biological triplicates, generated by RNA-seq and polysome-seq technology. Our results show that the next generation sequencing offers a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of mRNA content and its translation state within cells treated with translation inhibitory drug halofuginone (EPRS inhibitor). Based on our results, we conclude that Pro-rich motif bearing genes are preferential targets of EPRS, and mild inhibition of EPRS leads to inefficient translation of these PRR genes.

The selection of such cells allows for continued growth and survival, during hypoxia, acidosis, nutritional deprivation, drug treatment and radiation. However, there is great microenvironmental heterogeneity in every tumour. Must studies of gene regulation in vitro investigate whole cell populations, often by western blotting or mRNA expression. Thus, the individual variability of gene induction that could lead to selection, and basal cell molecular variability on which the selection operates, basic Darwinian principles, are not defined. We previously showed that two distinct populations can often be induced in epithelial tumour cell lines under hypoxia, identified by induction of Carbonic Anhydrase 9 [CA9].Here, we investigated the heterogeneity of breast cancer cells, and the relationship to the CA9 positive population in hypoxia, by using single cell sequencing analysis.

A prominent feature of quiescent MuSCs is a high content of heterochromatin. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which heterochromatin is maintained in MuSCs. We found that the mammalian Hairless (Hr) gene is expressed in quiescent MuSCs. Using a mouse model in which Hr can be specifically ablated in MuSCs, we demonstrate that Hr expression is critical for MuSC function and muscle regeneration. We show that Hr is a histone demethylase antagonist that preserves Histone 3 Lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and maintains heterochromatin structure. Loss of Hr results in reduced H3K9me3 levels, reduced heterochromatin, increased susceptibility of MuSCs to genotoxic stress, and the accumulation of DNA damage. Our study not only elucidates the molecular mechanism by which Hr regulates histone demethylases, but also demonstrates the importance of heterochromatin maintenance in stem cell function.		hindlimb muscles;Control;VCAM1+/CD31-/CD45-/Sca1-;Conditional Hairless knockout;muscle stem cells;C57BL/6;male;4-5 months

Here, we show a critical role of mini-chromosome maintenance protein (MCM) 10, a component of DNA replication machinery, in enabling CSCs to deal with DNA replicative stress. Our transcriptomic analysis of patient-derived cultured breast cancer cells revealed that MCM10 is strongly upregulated in CSC-enriched spheroid cells, compared to cancer cells cultured in a regular condition. Elevated MCM10 expression was correlated with worse prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Depletion of MCM10 resulted in not only reduced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, but also reduced tumor sphere forming efficiency, expression levels of stemness markers, and the tumor initiating ability. These results indicate that MCM10 is essential for maintenance of CSCs as well as for tumor cell proliferation. DNA fiber assay revealed that CSCs have a comparatively high level of DNA replicative stress. Overexpression of MCM10 helped cells to proliferate in a medium containing hydroxyurea (HU), a replicative stress-inducing chemotherapeutic agent. Conversely, MCM10 depletion made cells more fragile to replicative stress induced by HU or mitomycin C (MMC), another replicative stress inducer. Therefore, MCM10 plays critical roles for dealing with the enhanced replicative stress generated in CSCs for their survival, leading to maintenance of tumor initiating ability and drug resistance. We provide a preclinical rationale to target MCM10, the critical mediator for DNA replicative stress, for breast cancer that includes CSCs.

Mutations in NLRP7 gene is a major cause of familial recurrent complete HM, where no embryonic tissue is present during the pregnancy. NLRP7 is a novel protein and its function is poorly understood. Lack of NLRP7 in the mouse genome and challenges in studying human embryogenesis as well as human trophoblast differentiation has prevented elucidation of the pathophysiology of this disease and the function of NLRP7 in HM. Here, we established an in vitro model of HM using NLRP7 deficient patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Whole transcriptome profiling during trophoblast differentiation revealed that NLRP7 deficiency results in precocious downregulation of pluripotency factors, activation of trophoblast genes and promotes maturation of differentiated extraembryonic cell types such as syncytiotrophoblasts. We further showed that these phenotypes are dependent on BMP4 signaling and BMP pathway inhibition prevented excessive trophoblast differentiation of HM-iPSCs. Taken together, this novel human iPSC model of a genetic placental disease recapitulates aspect of trophoblast biology and sheds light on early human embryogenesis by identifying NLRP7 as an important regulator of this process.

These interactions negatively influence therapeutic response and increase the risk for drug resistance and relapse. It is still not clear why clinically similar tumors in different patients respond differently to established treatment regimens. Objective: The main aim of this study was to identify and compare key signaling pathways related to stromal cell adhesion in different mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines.Methods: Human MCL cells (JeKo1 and REC1) were cultured alone or in co-culture with mouse MS-5 stromal cells. Differentially expressed genes in adherent cells were identified by RNA sequencing and species-specific read sorting. The cell surface levels of proteins encoded by selected differentially expressed genes were quantified using flow cytometry in adherent and suspension cells. Selective inhibitors or siRNA were used to assess their significance for adherence to stromal cells. Results: Jeko1 and REC1 cells exhibited different time-dependent patterns of adhesion to stromal cells. 590 genes that were differently regulated upon adhesion in each cell line individually, showed significant differences in the extent or direction of regulation between the two cell lines. From this set, there was a significant increase in transcript levels for B-cell Receptor (BCR) pathway signature genes in adherent JeKo1 cell but not in adherent REC1 cells. Inhibition of BCR signaling using siRNA or the clinically approved inhibitor, Ibrutinib, decreased the number of adherent JeKo1 cells but had no such effect on REC1 cells. The cell surface levels of CXCR4 were higher in JeKo1 cells compared to REC1 cells and CXCR4 inhibition disrupted the adhesion of JeKo1 but not REC1 cells to the stromal cells. ICAM1 cell surface levels were induced in JeKo1 cells upon adhesion while REC1 showed a high level of ICAM1 in non-adherent cells. Depletion of ICAM1 levels by siRNA reduced the stromal cell adhesion of both JeKo1 and REC1 cells. Conclusions: The results suggest that different MCL cell lines exhibit different signaling profiles and pathway dependencies during microenvironment interaction. In this study BCR signaling pathways were shown to be important for stromal cell adhesion of JeKo1 cells but not REC1 cells. This provides a possible mechanism to account for the differential responsiveness of MCL patients to treatment with the Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor, Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of BCR signaling that is clinically approved for MCL.

Alignment and quantification of raw data was performed through CellRanger v4.0.0 (10X Genomics) with reference to mm10 genome (FASTA). Results : As a result of mapping sequence reads to the reference genome (mm10) using the CellRanger count function, we obtained count data of 36030 filtered cells for 32285 features. R package Seurat (v 3.2.3) was used to perform additional analysis of filtered data including clustering. After classifying the clusters with the cell type marker from the clustering results of the entire cell data, the clusters showing the high expression level (log2FC >2) of RPE65, a marker gene for RPE cells, were isolated. In the isolated 3355 cells, 5 clusters and their marker genes were identified. Conclusion : In this study, we could find changes in heterogeneous composition and senescence in mouse RPE cells. RPE cells were classified into clusters according to their heterogeneity, and anti-apoptotic and senescent changes were confirmed through changes in gene expression in the Dox-treated in vivo mouse model. Some of the DEGs of Con vs Dox contained genes that have not yet been identified related to senescence. The RPE-specific transcriptome in this study enhances the understanding of the role of RPE senescence in AMD and will therefore be useful for developing treatments targeting RPE senescence and testing their effectiveness.

Here we found that neuronal ablation of Arf1, a small GTPase important for lipid homeostasis, promoted the accumulation of peroxidated lipids, lipid droplets and ATP in the mouse brain and led to neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration, mainly in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Ablation of Arf1 in cultured primary neurons led to an increase in peroxidated lipids in co-cultured microglia, the activation of the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome, and the release of inflammatory cytokines in an APOE-dependent manner. Deleting the Nlrp3 gene rescued the neurodegenerative phenotypes in the neuronal Arf1-ablated mice. We also observed a reduction in Arf1 in human brain tissue from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis patients. Together, our results uncover a previously unrecognized role of peroxidated lipids released from damaged neurons in the activation of a neurotoxic microglial NLRP3 pathway that may play a role in human neurodegeneration.

In this study, we identified miR-33b-3p as a suppressor of metastasis in prostate cancer. miR-33b-3p was significantly reduced in prostate cancer tissues, and the low expression of miR-33b-3p was correlated with poor overall survival of prostate cancer patients. Overexpression of miR-33b-3p inhibited both migration and invasion of highly metastatic prostate cancer cells whereas antagonizing miR-33b-3p promoted those processes in lowly metastatic cells. The in vivo results demonstrate that miR-33b-3p suppresses metastasis of tail vein inoculated prostate cancer cells to lung, liver, and lymph node in mice. DOCK4 was validated as the direct target of miR-33b-3p. miR-33b-3p decreased the expression of DOCK4 and restoration of DOCK4 could rescue miR-33b-3p inhibition on cell migration and invasion. Moreover, downregulation of miR-33b-3p was induced by bortezomib, the clinically used proteasome inhibitor, and overexpression of miR-33b-3p rescued the insufficient inhibition of bortezomib on migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that miR-33b-3p suppresses metastasis by targeting DOCK4 in prostate cancer. Our results suggest that enhancing miR-33b-3p expression may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming that proteasome inhibitor’s poor efficacy against metastatic prostate cancer.

The Hippo pathway is a kinase signaling cascade that regulates cell proliferation during the growth of the heart. Inhibition of the Hippo pathway increases the activation of the transcription factors YAP/TAZ, which translocate to the nucleus and upregulate transcription of pro-proliferative genes. The Hippo pathway regulates the proliferation of cancer cells, pluripotent stem cells, and epithelial cells through a cell-cell contact-dependent manner, however, it is unclear if cell density-dependent cell proliferation is a consistent feature in cardiac myocytes. Here, we used cultured human iPSC-derived cardiac myocytes (hiCMs) as a model system to investigate this concept. hiCMs have a comparable transcriptome to the immature cardiac myocytes that proliferate during heart development in vivo. Our data indicate that a dense syncytium of hiCMs can regain cell cycle activity and YAP expression and activity when plated sparsely or when density is reduced through wounding. We found that combining two small molecules, XMU-MP-1 and S1P, increased YAP activity and further enhanced proliferation of low-density hiCMs. Importantly, these compounds had no effect on hiCMs within a dense syncytium. These data add to a growing body of literature that link Hippo pathway regulation with cardiac myocyte proliferation and demonstrate that regulation is restricted to cells with reduced contact inhibition.

Here, we use a liver-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) knock-out (L-GRKO) model and primary hepatocytes to investigate the temporal expression of GR target genes in response to feeding. Interestingly, in addition to the well described fasting-regulated genes, we identify a subset of hepatic feeding-induced genes that requires GR for full expression, adding new insights to hepatic GR function. The GR-controlled feeding-induced genes include Gck encoding the glucokinase, which is important for hepatic glucose uptake, utilization and storage. We show that insulin and glucocorticoids cooperatively regulate Gck expression in primary hepatocytes in a GR-dependent manner. ChIP-seq experiments suggest direct GR regulation of Gck by GR occupancy of the promoter and two putative regulatory regions near the Gck gene (Gck -1kb and Gck -4.6kb). Enhancer-reporter assays and CRISPRi suggest that the 4.6kb upstream GR binding site is a functional Gck enhancer. L-GRKO blunts preprandial and early postprandial Gck expression and GR disruption ultimately affects early postprandial hepatic glucose uptake, phosphorylation and glycogen storage. Collectively, our study demonstrates how GR is positively involved in the hepatic feeding response exemplified in the direct regulation of the feeding-induced transcription of glucokinase, important for hepatic glucose metabolism.		rRNA depleted RNA;Dexamethasone;fed;non treated;Cocktail: PA1-511A (Invitrogen), MA1-510 (Invitrogen), sc-1004 (Santa-Cruz);Liver;unfed;ZT18;Dexamethasone+insulin;Insulin;C57BL/6;vehicle;ZT22;ZT12;ZT10;Sprague Dawley;primary hepatocyte;ZT13;ZT14;Nr3c1fl/fl;AAV-tbg-CRE;AAV-tbg-GFP

Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with T cells sorted from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and patients with B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Unbiased bioinformatics analysis enabled us to identify 13 T cell clusters in the patients based on their molecular properties. All 11 major T cells subsets in healthy individuals were found in the patients with B-ALL, with the counterparts in the patients universally showing more activated characteristics. Two exhausted T cell populations, characterized by up-regulation of TIGIT, PDCD1, HLADRA, LAG3, and CTLA4 were specifically discovered in B-ALL patients. Of note, these exhausted T cells possessed remarkable heterogeneity, and ten sub-clusters were further identified, which were characterized by different cell cycle phase, naïve states, and GNLY (coding granulysin) expression. Coupled with single-cell T cell receptor repertoire profiling, we suggested diverse originations of the exhausted T cells in B-ALL, and clonally expanded exhausted T cells were likely to originate from CD8+ effector memory/terminal effector cells. Together, these data provide for the first-time valuable insights for understanding exhausted T cell populations in leukemia.		p1;p2;B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia;p3;Peripheral blood;h1;CD45+CD3+;h2;T cells;healthy individual

Moreover, whole body or hepatocyte specific-deletion of, increases the sensitivity of mice to dioxin-induced toxicities. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the loss of TIPARP catalytic activity would increase sensitivity to TCDD-induced toxicity in vivo. To test the hypothesis, we created a catalytically deficient mouse line (TiparpH532A) by introducing a single H532A mutation in Tiparp. Treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or hepatocytes isolated from TiparpH532A mice confirmed the increased TCDD-induced expression of the AHR target genes, Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1 and Tiparp. We also confirmed TCDD-dependent increases in Tiparp protein levels, as well as increased protein stabilization of TiparpH532A compared Tiparp+/+ protein. TiparpH532A mice given a single injection of 10 ug/kg dioxin, a non-lethal dose in Tiparp+/+ mice, did not survive beyond day 10. All Tiparp+/+ mice survived the 30-day treatment. Dioxin treated TiparpH532A mice displayed increased expression of Ahr target genes, increased steatohepatitis and hepatotoxicity as indicated by increased alanine aminotransferase activity compared with wildtypes. Taken together, these data further support TIPARP as a key negative regulator of AHR activity and its specific loss of its catalytic activity is sufficient to increase the sensitivity to dioxin-induced hepatosteatosis and lethality. TIPARP has recently emerged as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic; however, AHR signalling and toxicity will need to be carefully considered in determining the consequences of TIPARP inhibition.

Endochondral ossification forms and grows the majority of the mammalian skeleton and is tightly controlled through gene regulatory networks. The forkhead box transcription factors Foxc1 and Foxc2 have been demonstrated to regulate aspects of osteoblast function in the formation of the skeleton but their roles in chondrocytes to control endochondral ossification are less clear. We demonstrate that Foxc1 expression is directly regulated by SOX9 activity, one of the earliest transcription factors to specify the chondrocyte lineages. Moreover we demonstrate that elevelated expression of Foxc1 promotes chondrocyte differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells and loss of Foxc1 function inhibits chondrogenesis in vitro. Using chondrocyte-targeted deletion of Foxc1 and Foxc2 in mice, we reveal a role for these factors in chondrocyte differentiation in vivo.  Loss of both Foxc1 and Foxc2 caused a general skeletal dysplasia predominantly affecting the vertebral column. The long bones of the limb were smaller and mineralization was reduced and organization of the growth plate was disrupted.  In particular, the stacked columnar organization of the proliferative chondrocyte layer was reduced in size and cell proliferation in growth plate chondrocytes was reduced.

Nanoparticles were supplied to proliferating C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells under different gravity and radiation levels (microgravity+cosmic radiations or Earth gravity+cosmic radiations on board the International Space Station; Earth gravity on ground). Biological responses were thus investigated at a transcriptional level by RNA next-generation sequencing. Lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were generated and intersected by taking into consideration relevant comparisons, which led to the observation of prevailing effects of the space environment over those induced by nanoceria, possibly due to its administration during spaceflight. In space, up-regulation of transcription was slightly preponderant over down-regulation, and it implied involvement of intracellular compartments, with the majority of DEGs being consistently over- or under-expressed whenever present. Cosmic radiations regulated a higher number of DEGs than microgravity and seemed to promote increased cellular catabolism. By taking into consideration space physical stressors alone, microgravity and cosmic radiations appeared to have opposite effects at transcriptional level despite partial sharing of molecular pathways. Interestingly, gene ontology denoted some enrichment in terms related to vision, when only effects of radiation were assessed. The regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 in space-relevant samples suggests perturbation of the intracellular redox homeostasis, and leaves open opportunities to antioxidant treatment for oxidative stress reduction in harsh environments.

However, specific mechanisms of inflammation are not well defined. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV antagonizes mitophagy, or the process of selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. The mechanism of antagonism was through interactions between NS5 and the host protein Ajuba to prevent Ajuba translocation to depolarized mitochondria. We further identify a role of Ajuba in mitophagy through augmenting PINK1 kinase activity. Mitophagy suppression in infected Ajuba-/- cells amplified the cellular integrated stress response (ISR) to promote ZIKV replication, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression dependent on the ISR kinase, PKR. Thus, ZIKV suppresses mitophagy to favor replication and this failure of mitochondrial quality control is translated to inflammation by PKR, suggesting new therapeutic targets to treat flavivirus disease.

A reliable model system that can recapitulate early stages of human embryogenesis would help solve this problem.Here we report a robust three-dimensional (3D), two-step induction protocol for generating blastocyst-like structures (EPS-blastoids) from human extended pluripotent stem (EPS) cells. Morphological and single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed that EPS-blastoids contain key cell lineages and are transcriptionally similar to human blastocysts. Furthermore, EPS-blastoids also exhibited the developmental potential to undergo post-implantation morphogenesis in vitro to form structures with a cellular composition and transcriptome signature similar to human embryos that had been cultured in vitro for 8 or 10 days. In conclusion, human EPS-blastoids provide a robust new experimental platform for studying early developmental stages of the human embryo.

While the acquisition of cellular plasticity in adult stem cells is essential for rapid restoration after tissue injury, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this process.

Temporal Notch inhibition in secretory cells is required for alveolar differentiation upon injury, which is mediated by IL-1β-dependent modulation of Jag1/2 expression in ciliated cells.

To unveil the molecular regulation of this balance we compared human testicular tissues with severely perturbed germ cell differentiation with the normal situation. By performing single cell RNA sequencing of close to 30.000 cells and histomorphometric analysis we demonstrate that the proportion of spermatogonia remains remarkably stable despite the dwindling numbers of differentiated germ cells. In spite of this, these samples displayed altered stem cell dynamics with a push of reserve stem cells towards differentiation. This shift in dynamics was associated with the activation of gene networks regulated by four main gatekeeping transcription factors: ASCL2, EGR4, HOXC9, and DLX5. We provide invaluable information on the pathways regulating human germline stem cell dynamics along with evidence for a striking depletion of the reserve stem cell pool when these are disturbed.

However, clinical translation into biomarker development for functional change in microglia has not been achieved. Here, we find the close association of the metabolic reconfiguration of microglia with increased hippocampal glucose uptake, which can be noninvasively estimated by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). We found that increased FDG activity in the hippocampus of an AD mouse model depended on microglial uptake. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the hippocampus showed the changes of glucose metabolism profiles including glucose transporters, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation mainly occurred in microglia. A subset of microglia with high glucose transporters with defective glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation was increased according to disease progression. Furthermore, we also found a positive association between a soluble TREM2 of cerebrospinal fluid, a marker of microglial activation, and hippocampal FDG uptake as a human study. We identified a reconfiguration of microglial glucose metabolism in the hippocampus of AD and suggested a feasible imaging biomarker based on widely used FDG PET to reflect microglial metabolic profiles.		9 months;2 months;WT_hippocampus;5xFAD; AD model;5xFAD_hippocampus;B6SJL;6 months;WT;Hippocampus

Among MB subgroups, patients with enhanced levels of the c-MYC oncogene (MBGroup3) have the poorest prognosis. Here we identified a previously unrecognized role of the pro-autophagy factor AMBRA1 in regulating MB. We demonstrated that AMBRA1 expression levels strongly depend on c-MYC expression and correlate with patient poor prognosis; also, knockdown of AMBRA1 reduces MB stem potential, growth and migration of MBGroup3 cells in vitro and in vivo. At a molecular level, AMBRA1 mediates these effects by suppressing SOCS3, an inhibitor of STAT3 activation. In turn, active STAT3 increases c-MYC expression that, in a positive feedback loop, sustains AMBRA1 transcription. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy profoundly affects stem potential and metastasization of MBGroup3 cells in vitro and in vivo, and a combined anti-autophagy and anti-STAT3 approach impacts MBGroup3 cell survival. Taken together, our data identified the c-MYC/AMBRA1/STAT3 axis as a strong oncogenic signalling pathway with significance for both patient stratification strategies and targeted treatments of MBGroup3.

However, there is no specific therapy developed for RV failure. To understand RV failure, we focused on the RV specific genes. Global gene expression analysis showed that alternative complement pathway-related genes including C3 and Cfd were significantly upregulated in right ventricle in murine heart. We generated the RV failure by right ventricle-specific pressure overload model mice, pulmonary artery constriction (PAC), which induces RV failure around 14 days. In C3 knockout (C3KO) mice, PAC-induced RV dysfunction and fibrosis were significantly attenuated. C3a is produced from C3 by C3 convertase complex including Cfd. Cfd knockout mice also attenuated PAC-induced RV failure. Moreover, C3a receptor (C3aR) antagonist dramatically improved PAC-induced RV dysfunction in wild type mice. Here we revealed the crucial role of C3-Cfd-C3a-C3aR axis in RV failure and highlight the potential therapeutic target for RV failure with no pharmacologic option.

However, transcriptional programming of decidual MAIT cells in pregnancy remains poorly understood. Method of Study: We employed a multiomic approach to address this question. Mononuclear cells from the decidua basalis and parietalis, and control PBMCs, were analyzed via flow cytometry to investigate MAIT cells in the decidua and assess their transcription factor expression. In a separate study, both decidual and matched peripheral MAIT cells were analyzed using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) coupled with gene expression analysis. Lastly, decidual MAIT cells were stimulated with E. coli and expression of MR1 by antigen presenting cells was measured to evaluate decidual MAIT cell function. Results: First, we identified MAIT cells in both the decidua basalis and parietalis. CITE-seq, coupled with scRNAseq gene expression analysis, highlighted transcriptional programming differences between decidual and matched peripheral MAIT cells at a single cell resolution. Transcription factor expression analysis further highlighted transcriptional differences between decidual MAIT cells and non-matched peripheral MAIT cells. Functionally, MAIT cells are skewed towards IFNg and TNFa production upon stimulation, with E. coli leading to IFNg production. Lastly, we demonstrate that MR1, the antigen presenting molecule restricting MAIT cells, is expressed by decidual APCs. Conclusion: MAIT cells are present in the decidua basalis and obtain a unique gene expression profile. The presence of MR1 on APCs coupled with in vitro activation by E. coli suggests that MAIT cells might be involved in tissue-repair mechanisms at the maternal-fetal interface.

However, the roles of ASH1L and its enzymatic activity in the development of MLL-rearranged leukemias are not fully elucidated in Ash1L gene knockout animal models. In this study, we used an Ash1L conditional knockout mouse model to show that loss of ASH1L in hematopoietic progenitor cells impaired the initiation of MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation in vitro. Furthermore, genetic deletion of ASH1L in the MLL-AF9-transformed cells impaired the maintenance of leukemic cells in vitro and largely blocked the leukemia progression in vivo. Importantly, the loss of ASH1L function in the Ash1L-deleted cells could be rescued by wild-type but not the catalytic-dead mutant ASH1L, suggesting the enzymatic activity of ASH1L was required for its function in promoting MLL-AF9-induced leukemic transformation. At the molecular level, ASH1L enhanced the MLL-AF9 target gene expression by directly binding to the gene promoters and modifying the local histone H3K36me2 levels. Thus, our study revealed the critical functions of ASH1L in promoting the MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis, which provides a molecular basis for targeting ASH1L and its enzymatic activity to treat MLL-arranged leukemias.

While the increase in the prevalence of obesity is partly attributable to changes in lifestyle (i.e. increased sedentarity and changes in eating behaviour), the metabolic and clinical impacts of these obesogenic conditions varies between sexes and genetic backgrounds. The conception of personalised treatments of obesity and its complications require a thorough understanding of the diversity of responses to conditions such as high-fat diet intake. By analysing nine genetically diverse mouse strains, we show that much like humans, mice respond to high-fat diet in a genetic- and sex-dependent manner. Results: Physiological and molecular responses to high-fat diet are associated with expression of genes involved in immunity and mitochondrial function. Finally, we find that mitochondrial function and supercomplex assembly may explain part of the diversity of physiological responses. By exploring the complex interactions between genetics and metabolic phenotypes via gene expression and molecular traits, we shed light on the importance of genetic background and sex in determining metabolic outcomes. In addition to providing the community with an extensive resource for optimizing future experiments, our work serves as an exemplary design for more generalizable translational studies.		129S1/SvImJ;CD;WSB/EiJ;Liver;f;HFD;CAST/EiJ;C57BL/6J;m;DBA/2J;PWK/PhJ;NOD/ShiLtJ;A/J;NZO/HlLtJ

Despite its prevalence, the functional consequences of SMARCA4 alterations on lung cancer initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and single-cell epigenomic profiling, we demonstrate that loss of Smarca4 sensitizes CCSP+ cells within the lung to malignant transformation and tumor progression, resulting in highly advanced dedifferentiated tumors and increased metastatic incidence. Consistent with these phenotypes, Smarca4-deficient tumors lack lung lineage transcription factor activities and instead show activation of embryonic stem cell-like programs, resembling a metastatic cell state. Thus, the SWI/SNF complex – via Smarca4 – acts as a gatekeeper for lineage-specific cellular transformation and metastasis during lung cancer evolution.

We used multi-epitope-ligand cartography (MELC) to spatially profile 20 biomarkers in 35,000 disseminated tumor cells (DTCs), hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells from eight neuroblastoma bone marrow metastases. We developed DeepFLEX, a single-cell image analysis pipeline for MELC data that combines deep learning-based cell and nucleus segmentation and overcomes frequent challenges of multiplex imaging methods. Comparisons of cell type proportions between samples indicated that microenvironmental changes in the bone marrow are associated with tumor cell infiltration and therapy response. Hierarchical clustering of DTCs revealed multiple phenotypes with highly diverse expression of markers such as FAIM2, which we propose as a complementary marker to capture DTC heterogeneity in neuroblastoma. This single-cell atlas is an important step towards a deeper understanding of DTCs and their interactions with the bone marrow niche.		ganglioneuroblastoma;ganglioneuroma;DTC-depleted bone marrow fraction (MNCs);Bone marrow;neuroblastoma;Non/low infiltrated bone marrow

A heterodimeric complex of CDK9 and one of three cyclin T subunits, P-TEFb is expressed at vanishingly low levels in latently infected memory CD4+ T cells and cellular mechanisms controlling its availability for proviral transcription are not well-defined. Using a well-characterized primary T-cell model of HIV latency alongside healthy donor memory CD4+ T cells, we sought to identify specific T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways that regulate the generation of transcriptionally active P-TEFb, defined as the coordinate expression of cyclin T1 and phospho-Ser175 CDK9. Unexpectedly, cellular treatment with diacylglycerol-mimicking protein kinase C (PKC) agonists in the absence of intracellular calcium mobilization with an ionophore was sufficient to stimulate active P-TEFb expression and reactivate latent HIV with minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, inhibition-based experiments demonstrated that PKC agonists and TCR-mobilized diacylglycerol signal through MAP kinases ERK1/2 rather than through PKC to effect the reactivation of both P-TEFb and latent HIV. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that of the four known isoforms of RasGRP, the diacylglycerol-dependent Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 is by far the predominantly expressed isoform in memory CD4+ T cells and should therefore mediate the activation of ERK1/2 upon TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge. Combined inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1/2 pathway alongside the ERK1/2 activator MEK prior to TCR co-stimulation abrogated active P-TEFb expression and strongly suppressed latent HIV reactivation. Therefore, contrary to prevailing models, the coordinate reactivation of P-TEFb and latent HIV in primary T cells in response to either TCR co-stimulation or PKC agonist challenge is largely independent of PKC activity but rather primarily involves two complementary signaling arms of the TCR cascade namely RasGRP1-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT-mTORC1/2.

The mechanisms underlying stress-mediated inflammation and future health risk are poorly understood. Monocytes are key in sustaining systemic inflammation, and recent studies demonstrate they maintain memory of inflammatory insults, leading to a heightened inflammatory response upon rechallenge. We show that PS induces remodeling of the chromatin landscape and transcriptomic reprogramming of monocytes skewing them to a primed hyperinflammatory phenotype. Monocytes from stressed mice and humans exhibit a characteristic inflammatory transcriptomic signature and are hyperresponsive upon stimulation with Toll-like receptor ligands. RNA and ATAC sequencing reveal that monocytes from stressed mice and humans exhibit activation of metabolic pathways (mTOR and PI3Kinase) and reduced chromatin accessibility at mitochondrial respiration loci. Collectively, our findings suggest that PS primes the reprogramming of myeloid cells to a hyperresponsive inflammatory state, which may explain how PS confers inflammatory disease risk.		64 years;control + untreated;isolated bone marrow monocytes;49 years;whole blood;74 years;C57BL/6J;stress + LPS;57 years;control + LPS;high stress;62 years;52 years;72 years;77 years;monocytes;stress;63 years;68 years;65 years;control;75 years;50 years;stress + untreated;60 years;low stress;70 years;8-12 weeks;66 years;71 years;56 years;61 years

Despite its prevalence, the functional consequences of SMARCA4 mutation on tumor initiation, progression and chromatin regulation in lung cancer remains poorly understood. Using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and single-cell epigenomic profiling, we demonstrate that loss of Smarca4 sensitizes CCSP+ cells within the lung in a cell-type dependent fashion to malignant transformation and tumor progression, resulting in highly advanced dedifferentiated tumors and increased metastatic incidence. Consistent with these phenotypes, Smarca4-deficient primary tumors lack lung lineage transcription factor activities and instead show hyper-activation of embryonic stem cell-like programs, resembling a metastatic cell state. Mechanistically, we show that all three classes of SWI/SNF complexes are unable to bind and open chromatin at distinct regulatory regions in the absence of SMARCA4, thereby preventing lineage factors from binding to their targets and maintaining cell identity – ultimately accelerating tumor progression. Thus, the SWI/SNF complex – via Smarca4 – acts as a gatekeeper for lineage-specific cellular transformation and metastasis during lung cancer evolution.

Although, specific ERV loci feature regulatory roles for host gene expression, most ERV integrations are transcriptionally repressed by Setdb1 mediated H3K9me3 and DNA methylation. However, the protein network which regulates deposition of these chromatin modifications is still incompletely understood. Here, we performed a genome-wide sgRNA screen for genes involved in ERV silencing and identified the GHKL ATPase protein Morc3 as top scoring hit.

We found that the GHKL ATPase domain of Morc3 is critical for ERV silencing, since mutants which cannot bind ATP, or which are defective in ATP hydrolysis cannot rescue the Morc3 ko phenotype. Proteomic analysis revealed that Morc3 mutant protein which cannot bind ATP fails to interact with the H3.3 chaperone Daxx. This interaction depends on Morc3 sumoylation, as Daxx lacking the SUMO interaction domain shows reduced association with Morc3.

The membrane receptors linking external biochemical cues and internal cell mechanics are incompletely understood. Here, we reveal that the axon guidance receptor Plexin-B2 regulates intracellular mechanotension, and this in turn impacts cell-cell/cell-matrix adhesiveness during self-assembly of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and neuroprogenitor cells (hNPCs) into epithelial structures. The altered tissue mechanics caused by Plexin-B2 deficiency or over expression affects stem cell behaviors as well as β-catenin and YAP mechanosensing. Strikingly, Plexin-B2 deficiency results in accelerated neuronal differentiation, while proper levels of Plexin-B2 activity are required for maintaining cytoarchitectural integrity of the neuroepithelium as modeled in cerebral organoids. Mechanistically, Plexin-B2 engages its extracellular and Ras-GAP domains for mechanoregulation via RAP1/2. Our studies establish mechanoregulation as a key function of Plexin-B2 during multicellular organization, thereby solidifying the principle of force- mediated regulation of stem cell biology and tissue morphogenesis.

IL-7Rα gain-of-function mutations are known drivers of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Although a subset of T-ALL patients display very high IL7R mRNA levels and cases with IL7R gains have been reported, the impact of IL-7Rα overexpression, rather than mutational activation, on leukemogenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that overexpression of IL-7Rα in tetracycline-inducible Il7r transgenic and Rosa26 IL7R knock-in mice drives thymus hyperplasia due to increased proliferation of T-cell precursors, which subsequently infiltrate lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow, ultimately leading to fatal leukemia. The tumors mimic key features of human T-ALL, including heterogeneity in immunophenotype and genetic subtype between cases, frequent hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt pathway that is paralleled by downregulation of p27Kip1 and upregulation of Bcl-2, and gene expression signatures evidencing JAK/STAT, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Notch signaling activation. Notably, we also find that established tumors no longer require high levels of IL-7R expression upon secondary transplantation and can progress even in the absence of IL-7, but remain sensitive to the Bcl-2 inhibitor Venetoclax. The relevance of these findings for human disease are highlighted by the fact that T-ALL patient samples with high wild type IL7R expression display a transcriptional signature resembling that from IL-7-stimulated pro-T cells and, critically, from IL7R mutant T-ALL cases. Overall, our studies demonstrate that high expression of IL-7Rα can promote T-cell tumorigenesis even in the absence of IL-7Rα mutational activation.		healthy control_thymus;IL7R Dox induced IL7R_thymus;control;tetracycline-inducible expression of IL-7R{alpha};F5;Thymus

Here, we uncovered critical roles of luminal progenitor cells expressing FRS2β, an inhibitory adaptor for ErbB signaling, to create the cytokines-rich CSC niche in mammary tissues. Deficiency of FRS2β greatly decreased mammary tumorigenesis with decreased tumor stroma in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-ErbB2 mice. Moreover, FRS2β-deficient precancerous mammary tissues did not allow tumorigenesis derived from xenografted wild type FRS2β tumor cells. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 and CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 12, stemness- and stroma-inducing cytokines, respectively, were expressed at low levels in FRS2β-deficient precancerous mammary cells. Treatment with inhibitors against these cytokines in precancerous mice greatly decreased tumorigenic potential. In addition, human breast cancer tissues in which FRS2β is highly expressed in tumor cells harbor more stroma, and are associated with poor prognosis. Thus, cytokines-rich CSC niche and tumor microenvironment induced by FRS2β expressed in luminal progenitor cells and tumor cells play important roles for tumorigenesis.

Such early cuprizone lesions are sufficient to trigger peripheral immune cell recruitment.

Time course studies showed that the severity of cuprizone-induced lesions positively correlates with the extent of peripheral immune cell recruitment.

Human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-FI and primary cells SKNAS were treated with 30µM of the BG-P1600-TAT for 48 hours, harvested, and total RNA was immediately isolated from three biological replicates of control (vehicle-treated) and BG-P1600-TAT-treated cells. Gene expression profiling experiments identified 14-gene BG-P1600-TAT molecular interference signature captured most biologically important significantly enriched records reflecting the putative molecular mechanisms of anti-cancer activities of the BG-P1600-TAT. In BG-P1600-TAT treated SK-N-FI cells, 753 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified compared to control vehicle-treated cells. Among 753 DEGs, 427 genes were down-regulated and 326 genes were up-regulated. In SKNAS cells, BG-P1600-TAT showed a significant effects on signal transduction pathways activated during cellular responses to IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, EGF, TGF, PDGF, and AR. Further BG-P1600-TAT also showed a significant effect on multiprotein complexes of potential biological and therapeutic significance, including several complexes engaged during apoptosis (BCL-2 family protein complex; Survivin complex; BAX complex; Caspase complex), angiogenesis (VEGF-A complex; Thrombospondin complex), and cell adhesion (Galectin complex; Integrin alpha/beta complexes).

Methods: mRNA profiles of isolated CD4+Foxp3eGFP+ from lymph nodes of three 35-day-old wild-type (WT) and three Il1rn-/- mice were generated by deep sequencing. RNA was extracted from sorted cells (5X10^4) using a Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit. RNA-seq was performed using the Smart-Seq2 platform. Smart-Seq2 libraries were prepared by the Broad Technology Labs and sequenced by the Joint Biology Consortium– associated Broad Genomics Platform. Transcripts were quantified by the Broad computational pipeline using Cuffquant version 2.2.1.  Results: WT and Il1rn-/- Tregs showed similar expression of multiple genes associated with suppressor function, including Foxp3, Il2ra, Il7r, and Ebi3 (a component of the suppressive cytokine IL-35), and transcription factors including E_o_m_e_s_, Tbx21 (encoding Tbet), and Irf4. Tregs from WT and Il1rn-/- _mice showed similar expression of genes encoding molecules involved in Treg localization and trafficking, including CXCR6, CXCR3, and CCR10. However, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified enhanced expression of genes encoding proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism (for example, NTHL1 and GABARAPL1) in Il1rn-/- Tregs and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos; for example, ATP5H and NDUFB3) in WT Tregs. Conclusions: Il1rn-/- Foxp3+ Tregs exhibited greater glycolytic capacity and reserve that WT Tregs.

Cells were seeded at P3 in cell culture plastic dishes. On day 35, one week prior to corticosteroids treatments, RDMw/oA medium was remove and iRPE cells were incubated in experimental corticosteroid-free medium (DMEM, high glucose, HEPES, no phenol red, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, charcoal stripped). On day 42, iRPE cells were treated for 24 h with the following corticosteroids treatments: aldosterone (10-7 M), cortisol (10-7 M) and cortisol (10-7 M) plus RU-486 (10-5 M). As corticosteroids were dissolved in ethanol (EtOH) or methanol (MeOH) control cells were treated with 0.1% EtOH or MeOH in medium. Total RNA samples extracted from iRPE were sequenced at the iGenSeq transcriptomic platform of the Brain and Spine Institute (ICM, Paris, France). RNA quality was checked by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system) and RNA with integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 7.8 to 8.2 was accepted for library generation. Quality of raw data has been evaluated with FastQC.

To better understand its mechanism of action, we investigated its impact on psoriatic lesions from 15 moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients undergoing secukinumab treatment. We characterized the longitudinal transcriptomic changes of whole lesional skin tissue as well as cutaneous CD4+ and CD8+ T effector cells and CD4+ T regulatory cells across 12 weeks of treatment. Secukinumab was clinically effective and reduced disease-associated overexpression of IL17A, IL17F, IL23A, IL23R, and IFNG in whole tissue as soon as 2 weeks after initiation of treatment. IL17A overexpression in T cell subsets, primarily CD8+ T cells, was also reduced. While secukinumab treatment resolved 89-97% of psoriasis-associated expression differences in bulk tissue and T cell subsets by week 12 of treatment, we observed expression differences involved in interferon signaling and metallothionein synthesis that remained unresolved at this time point as well as potential treatment-associated expression differences involved in IL-15 signaling. These changes were accompanied by shifts in broader immune cell composition based on deconvolution of RNA-seq data. In conclusion, our study reveals several phenotypic and cellular changes within the lesion that underlie clinical improvement from secukinumab.

The goal of this study was to characterise its component cells and network structure by conducting single-cell sequencing of SCN organotypic slices. scRNASeq libraries were prepared using 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead v2 kit. SCN cells, diluted in 0.04% BSA-nuclease-free water, reverse transcription master mix and partitioning oil, were loaded on a ChromiumTM Single Cell A Chip and run on the Chromium Controller to obtain at target cell recovery rate of 8,000 cells. Final libraries were sequenced on one flow cell of an Illumina HiSeq 4000 with a read length of 26bp for read 1 (cell barcode and unique molecule identifier and sample barcode) and 98bp for read 2 (RNA read) to yield approximately 340 million reads per sample. We sequenced 13,324 cells from 52 SCN slices at circadian time 7.5 (mid-day) over three independent sequencing runs, and 16,996 cells from 36 SCN slices at circadian time 15.5 (mid-night) over two independent sequencing runs.

Many pain disorders directly affect nociceptors but mechanistic insight into underlying pathway regulations is limited by the translational paresis from animal models to human pain disorders. Although transcriptomic data are available for rodent and post-mortem patient samples, no comprehensive transcriptomic data are currently available for human nociceptor development. Here, we performed paired long and small RNA sequencing for six timepoints during nociceptor differentiation from three different human iPSC cell lines. Complex bioinformatics analyses for differential gene expression, protein-protein interactions and mRNA targeting by microRNAs revealed five distinct differentiation stages with critical hub genes and microRNAs guiding nociceptor development. The online resource platform NOCICEPTRA was specifically developed to visualize respective mRNA and microRNA trajectories, as well as query disease specific pathways, thereby enabling researchers to determine susceptibility windows for nociceptor-associated disorders as well as possible new treatment targets.

Lowering elevated blood glucose levels is the typical therapeutic goal in clinical medicine. However, it is possible that hyperglycemia is only a symptom of diabetes but not the correct target to monitor, in order to prevent late diabetic complications. Instead, other diabetes-related alterations could be primary causes for late diabetic complications. Here, we studied the role of CaM Kinase II δ (CaMKIIδ) that is activated through diabetic metabolism. CaMKIIδ is expressed ubiquitously and might therefore affect several different organ systems. We crossed diabetic leptin receptor mutant mice to mice lacking CaMKIIδ globally. Remarkably, CaMKIIδ-deficient diabetic mice did not develop hyperglycemia. As potential underlying mechanisms, we found evidence for improved insulin sensing and increased glucose transport into skeletal muscle. Despite normoglycemia CaMKIIδ-deficient diabetic mice developed the full picture of diabetic nephropathy. In contrast, diabetic retinopathy was prevented. These data challenge the clinical concept of normalizing elevated high glucose levels in diabetes as a causative treatment strategy for late diabetic complications and call for a more detailed analysis of intracellular metabolites in different organs.

Despite advances in understanding the complexity of DC ontogeny and function by transcriptional programming, the significance of post-translational modifications in controlling tissue-specific cDC (subset) immunobiology remains elusive. Here, we identified the cell surface-expressed A-disintegrin-and-metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) as an essential regulator of cDC1 and cDC2 homeostasis in the splenic marginal zone (MZ). Mice with a CD11c-specific deletion of ADAM10 (ADAM10ΔCD11c) exhibited a complete loss of splenic ESAMhi cDC2A, because ADAM10 controlled their commitment, differentiation, survival, and EBI2-mediated localization within the MZ. Moreover, we discovered that ADAM10 is a molecular switch regulating cDC2 subset heterogeneity in the spleen, as this unbalanced cDC2A homeostasis in the absence of ADAM10 was compensated for by the emergence of a novel Clec12a+ cDC2B subset, closely resembling cDC2 generally found in peripheral lymph nodes. Moreover, in ADAM10ΔCD11c mice terminal differentiation of cDC1 was abrogated, resulting in reduced numbers of Langerin+ cDC1.		KO;spleen;WT;dendritic cell;C57BL/6

Methods: Cerebral cortical mRNA profiles of 3-month-old Emx1-Cre-mediated Brap conditional knockout mice (BrapcKO) and their Cre-negative control littermates (Brap flox Cre-) were generated by next-generation sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq4000. Five BrapcKO and five control samples were analyzed. The quality of raw sequencing data was assessed using FastQC. Sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed by several methods, including DESeq2, edgeR, and Iimma, to discover differentially expressed genes. Results: We obtained more than 30 million sequence reads per sample that are uniquely mapped to the mouse reference genome (build mm10). After alignment of reads, expression levels of individual genes were quantified and estimated using subread::featureCounts. With the removal of lowly expressed genes using the threshold at least 10 raw read counts, 14,276 out of 21,969 annotated, valid mouse genes were retained for further analysis. Data were analyzed using several state-of-the-art tools, including DESeq2, edgeR, and Iimma, with a fold change ≥1.5 and FDR < 0.1. We collected overlapped differentially expressed mRNA genes detected with more than one method, and identified 811 differentially expressed genes between BrapcKO and control group. Conclusions: Our study represents detailed analysis of transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The data provide insight into the neurological defects of BrapcKO mice.		cerebral cortex;Brapflox/floxCre+;Brapflox/wt Cre-;Brapflox/flox Cre-;Brapflox/ko Cre+;C57BL/6;3 month

A localized Wnt3a can induce asymmetric division of mouse embryonic stem cells, whereas proximal daughter cells maintain self-renew and distal daughter cells acquire hallmarks of differentiation. Here, we develop an approach, SET-seq (same cell epigenome and transcriptome sequencing), to jointly profile epigenome and transcriptome in the same single cell. By utilizing SET-seq, we profile H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 with gene expression in Wnt3a induced asymmetric cell division. H3K27me3, but not H3K4me3, is correlatedly changed with gene expression.

This system enables timing of a broad range of essential retinal functions to anticipate daily changes in environmental lighting conditions. Furthermore, the circadian clocks appear to promote retinal health. A leading cause of blindness in developed countries is diabetic retinopathy. While it is clear that diabetes affects the master clock and its circadian output in the SCN, the effect of diabetic retinopathy on the retinal clock system is unknown.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly lethal disease that is driven by GBM stem cells (GSCs). However, methods that selectively eradicate the GSCs remain limited. Here, we employed a chemical biology approach to identify novel compounds and strategies that target GSC proliferation, invasiveness and stemness. We studied the effect of sulconazole (SN) previously reportedly known as an antifungal drug. In GSCs SN inhibited multiple biotin-dependent carboxylases by competing with biotin, an important co-factor for these enzymes. Consequently, there was reduced carbon flux into the cholesterol biosynthesis and TCA cycle pathways, depleting intracellular cholesterol and impairing oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in impaired GSC proliferation. Notably, these metabolic changes were GSC-specific and undetected in SN treated mouse astrocytes. Thus, the pharmacologic inhibition of biotin-dependent carboxylases represents a viable therapy for GBM.

Several consequences of OS including cell recovery and apoptosis have been described previously. In this study, we report systems model of the temporal dynamics of the oxidative stress response in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and characterize HMOX1 as a master regulator in orchestrating the response to oxidative stress. Methods: Following stress induction by hydrogen peroxide (HP), we carried out dose-dependent phenotypic assays and time series measurements of transcripts in HUVECs. To explore the role of HMOX1, HUVECs were transfected with scrambled siRNA or si-HMOX1 and then treated with hydrogen peroxide. Total RNA was collected from Scrambled-untreated, scrambled-H2O2, and si-HMOX1-H2O2 samples for RNAseq. Novel findings were validated by qPCR and functional assays. Results: In this study we have identified three phases of stress response (acute response from 1-2 hours, the transition from 4-6 hours, and the chronic stress response from 8-16 hours). We observe stable cell cycle arrest and impaired DNA replication/repair from 8-16 hours along with and increased resistance to apoptosis from 2-16 hours. Knockdown of HMOX1 prior to HP treatment releases the resistance to apoptosis. Similarly, many cellular processes switch their direction of regulation in HMOX1 deficient cells upon HP treatment (i.e. autophagy, mitochondria, cell surface signaling, expression of histone modifying enzymes and long-noncoding RNAs etc). Conclusions: Endothelial cell fate decisions are critically important for vascular health. In this study we provide a temporal model characterizing the transition from the acute stress response to the chronic response. The nexus of cell function and dysfunction is characterized by the concurrent activation of survival and death pathways. We explore the master regulatory role of HMOX1 and identify novel mechanisms by which HMOX1 may regulate cell fate decisions.

We show that cochlear function in an Ndp knockout (KO) mouse deteriorated with age: at P3-P4, hair cells (HCs) showed progressive loss of Pou4f3 and Gfi1, key transcription factors for HC maturation, and Myo7a, a specialized myosin required for normal function of HC stereocilia. Loss of expression of these genes correlated to increasing HC loss and profound hearing loss by 2 months of age. We show that overexpression of the Ndp gene in neonatal supporting cells or, remarkably, upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling in HCs rescued HCs and cochlear function. We conclude that Ndp secreted from supporting cells orchestrates a transcription factor network for the maintenance and survival of HCs and that increasing the level of b-catenin, the intracellular effector of Wnt signaling, is sufficient to replace the functional requirement for Ndp in the cochlea.

However, the full extent by which the CTD of PGC-1alpha regulates its function in gene expression and RNA processing remains largely unknown. Here, we used RNA-seq to evaluate the effects of CTD deletion (dCTD) on PGC-1alpha function. We found that deletion of the CTD of PGC-1alpha virtually abolished its effects on transcriptome remodeling and the resulting increase in oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, we implemented in vitro affinity purification followed by sequencing (in vitro AP-seq), which revealed more than 700 RNAs bound to the CTD of PGC-1alpha. The majority of these RNAs were transcribed at DNA regulatory elements such as promoters and distal intergenic regions. These results demonstrate that PGC-1alpha function is highly modulated at the CTD via multivalent protein-RNA interactions.

We examined the effect of human primary AECs on PDC functions by performing RNA-sequencing of PDCs after co-culture with air liquid interphase differentiated AECs. Co-culture led to the upregulation of transcripts included those encoding cytosolic sensors of DNA, ZBP-1,IRF-3 and NFkB as well as genes involved in amplification of the type 1 IFN response, such as IFNAR1, JAK/STAT, ISG15.

The primary aim of this study was to examine the transcriptional profile of drug resistant fusion-positive SLC25A40-ABCB1 fusion positive cells. Single cell fusion-positive and negative clones were derived from the human HGSOC cell line AOCS-18.5 Methods: Three independent replicates of RNA was collected from five SLC25A40-ABCB1 fusion-negative AOCS 18.5 clones (B,C, D,E,F) and five SLC25A40-ABCB1 fusion-positive AOCS 18.5 clones (8,9,13, 15B, 18B) and submitted for NextSeq 100bp paired-end, polyA RNA-sequencing. Cells were collected 48-72hrs post seeding. 20 million paired end reads per sample were generated. Reads were mapped to the human reference GRCh37.92 using the STAR two pass method (v2.6.0b). Counts were generated on the ensemble release GRCh37.92 GTF annotation using HTSeq (v0.10.0). Counts were normalized to logged TMM values using edgeR (v3.28.1). TPM expression values were also generated. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (v1.26.0) on the raw counts. In all, 3333 genes were significantly upregulated (>1.5 log2 fold change, p-adj<0.1) in fusion-positive lines, with 1751 genes significantly downregulated Conclusions: Using a stringent cut-off of >2.0 fold change (n=2238 differentially expressed genes), Metascape pathway analysis revealed that the most significantly enriched pathways in fusion-positive clones included the NABA matrisome associated pathway (160/751 genes, 7.24%), followed by external encapsulating structure organization (102/398 genes, 4.62%) and regulation of cell adhesion (139/734 genes, 6.29%).

To identify RNA elements capable of directing transcripts to neurites, we designed and deployed a massively parallel reporter assay that tested the localization regulatory ability of thousands of sequence fragments drawn from endogenous 3′ UTRs. We identified peaks of regulatory activity within several 3′ UTRs and found that sequences derived from these peaks were both necessary and sufficient for RNA localization to neurites. These active localization elements were rich in adenosine and guanosine residues. They were also required to be dozens of nucleotides long as subsequences showed significantly reduced activity. Using RNA affinity and mass spectrometry, we found that the RNA-binding protein Unk was associated with the active localization elements. Depletion of Unk in cells reduced the neurite-enrichment of the active localization, indicating a functional requirement for Unk in their trafficking. These results provide a framework for the unbiased, high-throughput identification of RNA elements and mechanisms that govern transcript localization.

The model allows for the identification of canine osteosarcoma-specific gene signatures by RNA sequencing and a species-differentiating bioinformatics pipeline. An osteosarcoma-associated signature consisting of five gene transcripts was validated in dogs with osteosarcoma. Serum/plasma exosomes were isolated from 53 dogs in distinct clinical groups (“healthy”, “osteosarcoma”, “other bone tumor”, or “non-neoplastic disease”). Pre-treatment samples from osteosarcoma cases were used as the training set and a validation set from post-treatment samples was used for testing, classifying as “osteosarcoma–detected” or “osteosarcoma–NOT detected”. Dogs in a validation set whose post-treatment samples were classified as “osteosarcoma–NOT detected” had longer remissions, up to 15 months after treatment. In conclusion, we identified a gene signature predictive of molecular remissions with potential applications in the early detection and minimal residual disease settings. These results provide proof-of-concept for our discovery platform and its utilization in future studies to inform cancer risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response.

However, current anti-doping testing does not involve blood collection into tubes with RNA preservative. This study investigated if whole blood in short-term storage could be used for transcriptomic analysis despite lacking RNA preservation. Methods: Whole blood samples were collected from fourteen male healthy individuals. Short-term storage: whole blood collected into K2EDTA tubes and subjected to short-term (i.e., at 4°C) storage for 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours. After storage, blood from K2EDTA tubes were transferred into Tempus™ Blood tubes, and then extracted using Tempus™ Spin RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples from four subjects of each time point that presented higher RIN value (≥7) were selected for RNA_Seq analysis. Results: The experiment provided RNA quality and purity for gene expression analysis. Considering 6-hours storage as a reference group, the number of differentially expressed genes were 19, 45 and 70 in comparison to 12, 24 and 48-hours, respectively (which means 0.37, 0.88 and 1.37% of mapped genes). Of the 19 differentially expressed genes in the comparison 6 vs. 12-hours, 9 overlapped with the 45 in the comparison 12 vs. 24-hours. Furthermore, 40 of those 45 overlapped with the 70 differentially expressed in the comparison 6 vs. 48-hours. None of the transcripts described in previous studies (Durussel et al. 2016; Wang, Durussel, et al. 2017) were differently expressed. Conclusion: RNA quantity, purity and integrity was not significantly compromised from short-term storage in blood storage tubes lacking RNA stabilisation, indicating that transcriptomic/omics analysis could be conducted using anti-doping samples collected without RNA preservation.

We wondered whether the specificity of T cells found in PBC livers and tumors developing post-PBC might be shared to some extent, comparing them to circulating T cells from the blood (Paillet et al, J Exp Med, 2021). Single-cell TCR sequencing coupled to single-cell RNA sequencing (scTCR/RNA-seq) led to the identification of 8112 distinct clonotypes with a hierarchy of clonotypes enrichment that was significantly higher in PBC livers than in peripheral blood, as well as in CCA compared to blood and liver. Indeed, 12 distinct clonotypes accounted for ~20% of the tumor T cell infiltrate. The overlap of clonotypes between liver and tumor was superior to the overlap between blood and liver, or blood and tumor. Among the 128 clonotypes enriched (i.e. accounting for > 0.1% of total T cells infiltrating the tissue) in the tumor, 25 were also detected and enriched in the liver. Two clonotypes (#2 and #13) were particularly expanded, each representing over 0.5% of the total T cell population in both liver and tumor post-PBC (Paillet et al, J Exp Med, 2021). Bioinformatic analysis of the scRNA-seq data of total T cells isolated from the liver and tumor of a PBC mouse revealed a net distinction between the transcriptome of T lymphocytes located in the two organs. Only one phenotypic cluster (h) was observed in both liver and tumor. The 25 liver/tumor dual-enriched (>0.1%) clonotypes were spread across few clusters (mostly c, j, k in the tumor; b and i in the liver). Among these clusters, three corresponded to CD8+ T cells (c, i, k) and two corresponded to CD4+ T cells (b, j). They exhibited a preponderant Tc1/Th1 polarization as illustrated by the expression of the enhancers Tbx21 and/or Eomes, and of effector molecules, namely IFNγ for Th1 (b, j), or the cytotoxic markers granzymes B and K for Tc1 (c, i, k) (Paillet et al, J Exp Med, 2021). Interestingly, the two clusters containing most of the enriched CD4+ T cell clonotypes presented a multifunctional signature characterized by the co-expression of IFNγ along with either IL4 (cluster b in the liver) or GzmB and KLRG1 (cluster j in the tumor). Clearly, the two most enriched clonotypes shared between CCA tumor and PBC liver belonged to the category of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (clusters c + k in tumor, and cluster i in the liver). Moreover, they showed signs of prolonged activation/exhaustion with the expression of Pdcd1 (encoding PD-1), Lag3, Harvc2/Tim3 and Tigit, yet in a lesser extent than another cluster of CD8+ T cells (tumor cluster f) that contains only little shared clonotypes (Paillet et al, J Exp Med, 2021).

Over fifty years of intense research have revealed many key elements of the biology of this neurodegenerative disorder. However, our understanding of the molecular bases of the disease is still incomplete, and the available medical treatments for AD are mainly symptomatic and hardly effective. Indeed, the robustness of biological systems have revealed that the modulation of a single target is unlikely to yield the desired outcome, and we should move from gene-centric to systemic therapeutic strategies. Here, we present the complete characterization of three murine models of AD at different stages of the disease (i.e. onset, progression and advanced). To identify genotype-to-phenotype relationships, we combine the cognitive assessment of these mice with histological analyses and a full transcriptional and protein quantification profiling from hippocampus. Comparison between the gene and protein expression trends observed in AD progression and physiological ageing exposed certain commonalities, such as the upregulation of microglial and inflammation markers. However, although there is an accelerated ageing in AD models, there are other factors specifically associated with A_ pathology. Despite the clear correlation between mRNA and protein levels of the dysregulated genes, we discovered a few proteins whose abundance increases with AD progression, while the corresponding transcript levels remain stable. Indeed, we show that at least two of these proteins, namely lfit3 and Syt11, co-localize with A_ plaques in the brain. Finally, we derive specific A_-related molecular AD signatures, and we look for drugs able to globally revert them. We found two NSAIDs (dexketoprofen and etodolac) and two anti-hypertensives (penbutolol and bendroflumethiazide) that overturn the cognitive impairment in AD mice while reducing A_ plaques in the hippocampus and partially restoring the physiological levels of AD signature genes to wild-type levels.

GSE168428	2021.09.03	Mus musculus	GPL17021	TRUE	FALSE	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE	GSE168431		Identification and drug-induced reversion of molecular signatures of Alzheimer´s disease onset and progression in AppNL-G-F, AppNL-F and 3xTg-AD mouse models (RNA-seq: WT/3xTg)	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Over fifty years of intense research have revealed many key elements of the biology of this neurodegenerative disorder. However, our understanding of the molecular bases of the disease is still incomplete, and the available medical treatments for AD are mainly symptomatic and hardly effective. Indeed, the robustness of biological systems have revealed that the modulation of a single target is unlikely to yield the desired outcome, and we should move from gene-centric to systemic therapeutic strategies. Here, we present the complete characterization of three murine models of AD at different stages of the disease (i.e. onset, progression and advanced). To identify genotype-to-phenotype relationships, we combine the cognitive assessment of these mice with histological analyses and a full transcriptional and protein quantification profiling from hippocampus. Comparison between the gene and protein expression trends observed in AD progression and physiological ageing exposed certain commonalities, such as the upregulation of microglial and inflammation markers. However, although there is an accelerated ageing in AD models, there are other factors specifically associated with A_ pathology. Despite the clear correlation between mRNA and protein levels of the dysregulated genes, we discovered a few proteins whose abundance increases with AD progression, while the corresponding transcript levels remain stable. Indeed, we show that at least two of these proteins, namely lfit3 and Syt11, co-localize with A_ plaques in the brain. Finally, we derive specific A_-related molecular AD signatures, and we look for drugs able to globally revert them. We found two NSAIDs (dexketoprofen and etodolac) and two anti-hypertensives (penbutolol and bendroflumethiazide) that overturn the cognitive impairment in AD mice while reducing A_ plaques in the hippocampus and partially restoring the physiological levels of AD signature genes to wild-type levels.		15m;F880;Hippocampal sample from WT mouse;WT_3m;F862;F866;F1284;F1360;F867;F825;F826;F848;F805;F1287;F1389;3m;F1423;WT;F1227;3xTg;Hippocampal sample from 3xTg mouse;hippocampus;WT_8m;WT_15m;B1;3xTg_8m;F852;B2;B3;3xTg_3m;F855;B4;3xTg_15m;F835;8m;F1252;F1310;F1279;F817;F1432;F1357;F1316

HIV-associated TB is mainly the result of recent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) followed by rapid progression to disease. Alveolar macrophages (AM) are the first cells of the innate immune system that engage Mtb, but how HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) impact on the anti-mycobacterial response of AM is not known. In this study AM were challenged in vitro with Mtb, and their epigenetic and transcriptomic responses were determined for PLWH receiving ART, control subjects who were HIV-free (HC) and subjects who received pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with ART to prevent HIV infection. Compared to HC subjects’ response to Mtb, we showed that AM isolated from PLWH and PrEP subjects displayed substantially weaker transcriptomic response and no significant changes in their chromatin state. These findings revealed a previously unknown adverse effect of ART.

Autocrine production of hepatocyte growth factor by myeloid blasts drives leukemogenesis in pre-clinical models. A phase Ib trial evaluated ficlatuzumab, a first-in-class anti-HGF antibody, in combination with cytarabine in this high-risk population. Dose-limiting toxicities were not observed, and 20 mg/kg was established as the recommended phase II dose. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was febrile neutropenia. Among 17 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 53%, all complete remissions. Phospho-proteomic mass cytometry showed potent on-target suppression of p-MET after ficlatuzumab and that attenuation of p-S6 was associated with clinical response. Multiplexed single cell RNA sequencing using longitudinally collected patient specimens identified interferon and MYC target genes as adverse predictive factors. The ficlatuzumab and cytarabine combination is well-tolerated with favorable efficacy. High-dimensional analyses at single-cell resolution represent promising approaches for identifying biomarkers of response and mechanisms of resistance in prospective clinical studies.		pbmc

Severe hearing impairment follows OHC degeneration. Previous attempts at regenerating new OHCs from cochlear supporting cells (SCs) have been unsuccessful, notably lacking expression of the key OHC motor protein, Prestin. Thus, regeneration of Prestin+ OHCs represented a barrier to restoring auditory function in vivo. Here, we reported the successful in vivo conversion of adult mouse cochlear SCs into Prestin+ OHC-like cells through the concurrent induction of two key transcriptional factors known to be necessary for OHC development: Atoh1 and Ikzf2. Single cell RNA sequencing reveals the upregulation of 729 OHC genes and downregulation of 331 SC genes in OHC-like cells. The resulting differentiation status of these OHC-like cells was much more advanced than previously achieved. This study thus established an efficient approach to induce the regeneration of Prestin+ OHCs, paving the way for in vivo cochlear repair via SC transdifferentiation.

In this study, we examine the role of this gene in neural crest cells, the precursors of bones and cartilages affected in MFDM patients. Methods: We generated a mutant mouse line with conditional mutation in Eftud2 and used Wnt1-Cre2 to delete it in neural crest cells. Results: We show that homozygous deletion of Eftud2 leads to neural crest cell death and malformations in the brain and craniofacial region of embryos. RNAseq analysis of embryonic heads revealed a significant increase in exon skipping and retained introns in mutants and enriched levels of Mdm2 transcripts lacking exon 3. Mutants also had increased nuclear P53, higher expression of P53-target genes, and increased cell death. Craniofacial development was significantly improved when mutant embryos were treated with Pifithrin-alpha, an inihibitor of P53. Conclusion: We propose that craniofacial defects caused by mutations of EFTUD2 are a result of mis-splicing of Mdm2 and P53-associated cell death. Hence, drugs that reduce P53 activity may help prevent craniofacial defects associated with spliceosomopathies.

We found that excessive branched chain amino acid (BCAA) accumulation, a metabolic signature of the post-infarcted heart, created an unfavorable milieu inhibiting the retention and cardioprotection of intramyocardially-delivered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). BCAA at pathological levels sensitized MSCs to the acquisition of a injured phenotype by suppressing the histone H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) modification. Furthermore, a novel mTORC1/DUX4/KDM4E axis was identified as the cause of the H3K9me3 loss and adverse phenotype acquisition induced by BCAA. Enhancing BCAA catabolism in MSCs via genetic or pharmacological approaches improved their adaptation to the extracellular BCAA milieu and strengthened their cardioprotective efficacy. These findings reveal a critical role of myocardial metabolic reprogramming in regulating the fate and cardioprotection of implanted MSCs after MI.

DP cells rearrange the T cell receptor gene Tcra to generate T cell receptors with TCR. Then DP cells differentiate into CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes, Regulatory T cells, or invariant nature kill T cells (iNKT) according to the TCR signal. Chromatin organizer SATB1 is highly expressed in DP cells and plays an essential role in regulating Tcra rearrangement and differentiation of DP cells. Here we explored the mechanism of SATB1 orchestrating gene expression in DP cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing assay of SATB1-deficient thymocytes showed that the cell identity of DP thymocytes was changed, and the genes specifically highly expressed in DP cells were down-regulated. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data showed the similar tendency. The super-enhancers regulate the expressions of the DP-specific genes, and the SATB1 deficiency reduced the super-enhancer activity. Hi-C data showed that interactions in super-enhancers and between super-enhancers and promoters decreased in SATB1 deficient thymocytes. We further explored the regulation mechanism of two SATB1-regulating genes, ETS2 and Bcl6, in DP cells and found that the knockout of the super-enhancers of these two genes impaired the development of DP cells. Our research reveals that SATB1 globally regulates super-enhancers of DP cells and promotes the establishment of DP cell identity, which helps understand the role of SATB1 in thymocyte development.

They reside in bone marrow (BM) endosteal and (peri)-vascular niches, which provide all cellular and molecular components required for their lifelong maintenance and fate. Among them, the CXCL12 chemokine and one of its receptor, CXCR4, exert a dominant role in promoting HSPC retention and quiescence. These processes are deregulated in the WHIM Syndrome (WS), a rare immunodeficiency caused by inherited heterozygous autosomal gain-of-function CXCR4 mutations that affect homologous desensitization of the receptor. Clinically, WS is notably characterized by severe, chronic circulating lymphopenia whose mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Using a mouse model carrying a naturally occurring WS-linked Cxcr4 mutation, we explored the possibility that the lymphopenia in WS originates from defects at the MPP level in BM. The global strategy consists in performing high-throughput RNA-seq analyses of the different MPP subsets bearing or not the WS-linked Cxcr4 mutation to investigate the impact of the gain-of-Cxcr4-function on the molecular identity of MPP subsets.

Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a rare autism spectrum-like disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delays and breathing problems involving episodes of hyperventilation followed by apnea. PTHS is caused by functional haploinsufficiency of the gene encoding transcription factor 4 (Tcf4). Despite the severity of this disease, virtually nothing is known regarding mechanisms contributing to PTHS behavioral abnormalities, and candidate therapeutic targets are lacking. Here, we show that a Tcf4 truncation (Tcf4tr/+) mouse model of PTHS recapitulates respiratory phenotypes observed in PTHS patients. The basis of this behavior deficit involves selective loss of putative expiratory parafacial neurons and compromised function of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus that regulate breathing in response to tissue CO2/H+. We also show that central Nav1.8 channels can be targeted pharmacologically to improve respiratory function at the cellular and behavioral levels in Tcf4tr/+ mice, thus establishing Nav1.8 as a high priority target with therapeutic potential in PTHS.

Greater epithelial ridge cells are methodologically homogeneous, while whether different cell subtypes are existence in this intriguing region and the degeneration mechanism during postnatal cochlear development are poorly understood. In the present study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on the cochlear duct of postnatal rats at day 1 (P1) and day 7 (P7) to identify subsets of greater epithelial ridge cell and progression. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were used to examine genes enriched biological processes in these clusters. We identified a total of 26 clusters at P1 and P7 rats and found that the cell number of five cell clusters decreased significantly, while four clusters had similar gene expression patterns and biological properties. The genes of these four cell populations were mainly enriched in Ribosome and P13K-Akt signal pathway. Among them, Rps16, Rpsa, Col4a2, Col6a2, Ctsk, and Jun are particularly interesting as their expression might contribute to the greater epithelial ridge cells degeneration. In conclusion, our study provides an important reference resource of greater epithelial ridge cells landscape and mechanism insights for further understanding greater epithelial ridge cells degeneration during postnatal rat cochlear development		cochlea;Sprague-Dawley;post natal day 1;greater epithelial ridge cell;post natal day 7

We hypothesized that the clinical response ACP in patients with knee OA will correlate with the biologic activity and composition of the ACP administered. To test our hypothesis, we enrolled 51 patients with mild-moderate knee OA. We collected clinical information at baseline, and patient reported outcomes at 6 weeks and 6 months after ACP injection. We evaluated the composition of ACP by multiplex ELISA, and the biologic activity of the same aliquots using an in vitro biologic assay paired with gene expression analyses. Patients were stratified as responders and non-responders to ACP based on achievement of minimal clinically important differences in patient reported outcomes collected at 6 weeks and 6 months. RNA sequencing revealed that ACP modulates inflammatory responses in a co-culture of macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (fibroblasts); using this data, we selected specific genes to evaluate the biologic activity of ACP in vitro. Comparison of ACP from responders and non-responders revealed differences in the composition and activity of ACP between these groups. By integrating clinical and multi-omics data, we uncovered changes in the composition and biologic activity of ACP that may correlate with outcomes in knee OA patients.

Using an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified SOCS1 as a major non-redundant checkpoint imposing a brake on antigen experienced CD4+ T-cell proliferation upon antigen challenge. Although SOCS1 has been previously described as an inhibitor of CD8+ T-cell effector function, we highlight here that it is abrogating the CD4+ T-cell response. SOCS1 integrates several cytokines receptor signals to actively silence TCR-induced polycytokine signaling pathways, restraining CD4+ T cell proliferation and functions. Targeting SOCS1 in mouse and human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells improved the therapeutic efficacy of antitumor adoptive T-cell therapies, enhancing intra-tumor T cell accumulation, persistence and effector functions. SOCS1 deletion in CAR-T cells enhances CD4+ CAR T-cell proliferation/survival and polyfunctionality in vivo, promoting long term rejection of established tumors.

Here we show that in mice gut surface enlarges by increasing food amount rather than caloric intake, contributing to an increased absorptive function, and that it can be reversed by reducing daily food amount. Genetic- and environment-induced gut enlargement due to overeating is principally supported by upregulation of the intestinal lipid metabolism and transport. Intestinal knock-out, and pharmacological inhibition of PPARα supress intestinal crypt formation and shorten villi in the small intestine of mice and in human intestinal biopsies, respectively, and diminish post-prandial triglyceride transport and nutrient uptake. PPARα inhibition limits lipid absorption and restricts lipid droplet growth and PLIN2 levels, critical for the droplet formation. This improves lipid metabolism, reduces body adiposity and liver steatosis, suggesting an alternative target for treating obesity.

P53 is rarely mutated and still functional in luminal types of breast cancer. According to current knowledge, wild type P53 function is tightly controlled by post-translational modification, such as ubiquitination. Several ubiquitin ligases were shown to regulate P53 ubiquitination and protein stability. Here, we report RNF187, a RING family ubiquitin ligase, facilitates breast cancer growth and inhibits apoptosis via modulating P53 signaling. RNF187 is elevated in breast cancer and correlates with breast cancer survival only in P53 wild type groups. The bio-informatics analysis shows that RNF187 negatively correlates P53 target gene expression, such as IGFBP3 and FAS in breast cancer. RNF187 depletion inhibits breast cancer growth and facilitates cell death. RNA sequencing analysis indicates that RNF187 could be an important modifier for P53 signaling. Further experiments show that RNF187 interacts with P53 and promotes P53 degradation via facilitating P53 poly-ubiquitination in breast cancer cells. Interesting, the in vitro ubiquitin assay shows that RNF187 could directly ubiquitinate P53, which is independent of MDM2. These finding reveals a novel direct P53 regulator and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.		siRNF187;human breast cancer cell line MCF-7;MCF-7;breast cancer;siControl

We produced mice that lacked CB-1 receptors in hepatocytes or stellate cells to determine if CB-1 signaling contributes to the development of NAFLD or liver fibrosis. Deletion of CB-1 receptors in hepatocytes did not alter the development of NAFLD in mice fed a high sucrose high fat diet (HSD) or high fat diet (HFD). Similarly, deletion of CB-1 deletion specifically in stellate cells also did not prevent the development of NAFLD in mice fed the HFD nor did it protect mice for carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis. To determine if a small population of cells in liver express CB-1 at high levels either before and/or after HSD feeding, here we performed single cell RNA-sequencing of livers from wild-type mice fed chow or a HSD for 17 weeks and analyzed CB-1 expression. Single-cell sequencing of hepatocytes and stellate cells reveals low Cnr1 expression in livers of mice fed a chow or HSD. Combined, these studies do not support a direct role for hepatocyte or stellate cell CB-1 signaling in the development of NAFLD or liver fibrosis.

GSE182132	2021.09.01	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	2	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Integrated Transcriptome and Multiple Activated Pathways in Endometrial Cancer	Because the incidence of endometrial cancer is notably increasing worldwide, it has become the leading gynecologic cancer in the United States. Standard treatment results in the loss of reproductive function in women of childbearing age. Furthermore, advanced cancer stages are associated with poor overall survival. The aim of this study was to explore the abnormal expression profile of genes during the development of endometrial cancer, which is essential to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved. Five pairs of endometrial cancer tissues and normal endometrial tissues were subjected to next-generation transcriptome sequencing technology. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to validate the expression profile of key differentially expressed genes (2.0-fold change, adj. p < 0.05) (DEGs) identified in the RNA-seq result. GO and KEGG pathways were used for bioinformatic analyses. The transcriptomic sequencing results showed 1153 DEGs, including 673 upregulated and 480 downregulated genes, in the EC specimens. Decreased expression of ID1, IGF1, GDF7, SMAD9, TGF-beta and WNT4, as well as GDF5, INHBA and ERBB4 overexpression, were confirmed in EC using RT-qPCR. Additionally, EC tissue exhibited marked enrichment in genes promoting cellular adhesion, proliferation, migration and plasma membrane. KEGG analysis revealed changes in various pathways, such as the TGF-beta, PI3K-Akt, Wnt, and estrogen pathways. Our data describe the molecular events involved in the pathogenesis of EC, which may be potential diagnostic markers and targets of therapeutic interventions.		normal endometrium;endometrial cancer tissue
GSE181738	2021.09.01	Mus musculus	GPL17021	TRUE	FALSE	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Epithelial Wnt secretion drives the progression of inflammation-induced colon carcinoma	Colon cancer is initiated by stem cells that escape the strict control. In most colon tumors this process is driven through aberrant activation of Wnt signaling by mutations that occur in components acting downstream of the receptor complex and that unfetter tumor cells from the need for Wnt ligands. Here we describe a special type of colon cancer that does not depend on mutated core components of the Wnt pathway. Genetically blocking Wnt secretion from epithelial cells of such tumors results in apoptosis, reduced expression of colon cancer markers, followed by enhanced tumor differentiation. In contrast to the normal colonic epithelium, such tumor cells auto-secrete Wnt ligands to maintain their uncontrolled proliferative behavior. In humans, we determined certain cases of colon cancers in which the Wnt pathway is hyperactive, but not through mutations in its core components. Our findings illuminate the path in therapy to find further subtypes of Wnt- dependent colon cancer, that might be responsive to Wnt secretion inhibitors.

Here we analyze the neurovascular unit (NVU) of pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) and diffuse midline glioma (DMG) using patient derived xenografts and natively forming glioma mouse models. We show tumor-associated vascular differences between these glioma subtypes, and parallels between PDX and mouse model systems, with DMG models maintaining a more normal vascular architecture, BBB function and endothelial transcriptional program relative to pHGG models. Unlike prior work in angiogenic brain tumors, we find that expression of secreted Wnt antagonists do not alter the tumor-associated vascular phenotype in DMG tumor models. Together, these findings highlight vascular heterogeneity between pHGG and DMG and differences in their response to alterations in developmental BBB signals that may participate in driving these pathological differences.

GSE179302	2021.09.01	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	35	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Physical Activity Moderates Inflammatory Gene Expression in Rheumatoid Arthritis	Background/Purpose: Prior studies show an independent association between greater physical activity and lower inflammatory markers among adults in the general population, but the impact of physical activity on systemic inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) hasn’t been thoroughly investigated. We therefore aimed to determine whether physical activity behavior associates with differential expression of inflammatory genes in RA. Methods: Data derive from baseline assessments for a prospective observational cohort of patients with RA. At each study visit, we obtained detailed clinical information, collected peripheral whole blood for subsequent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and provided participants with actigraphs (GT9X ActiGraph Link device) to objectively measure physical activity by wearing the device at home for 7 consecutive 24-hour periods. Participants were categorized into three physical activity groups based on the highest (“active”), middle (“intermediate”), and lowest (“inactive”) tertiles for percentage of time spent in moderate/vigorous physical activity (metabolic equivalent (MET) level ≥2.00) across the sample. Results: There were 35 patients with complete clinical, actigraphy, and transcriptomic data available for analysis. The participants had a mean age of 56 years, were 90% female, and self-reported the following racial/ethnic identities: 32% white, 11% African American, 8% Asian, 40% Hispanic. Participants spent 48%, 41%, and 12% of time awake in sedentary, light, and moderate physical activity, respectively. None of the participants achieved vigorous activity. The patients in the most active group were younger but did not otherwise significantly differ by clinical and demographic characteristics compared to the other physical activity groups. However, in the differential gene expression analysis comparing the highest versus lowest physical activity tertiles, there were 365 up- and 402 down-regulated genes at an adjusted P value < 0.1. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the most physically active patients exhibited downregulation of diverse innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways. Assessment of upstream cytokine activation states demonstrated inhibition of type I, II and III interferons and activation of EPO in the highest physical activity tertile patients. Conclusion: Among a racially and ethnically diverse RA cohort, participants who spent more time in moderately intense physical activity had down-regulation of genes involved in both innate and adaptive immune signaling compared to those who were more sedentary. These findings provide mechanistic evidence to support a disease-modifying effect of physical activity in RA.		20.4621269;Whole blood_activity_tertile_three;25.4742836;28.2681396;25.6292682;dk;25.9418483;22.6353146;three;22.5121483;multi;zero;25.541576;white;27.6312629;24.9085957;28.5833529;32.6426376;Whole blood_activity_tertile_one;female;26.4845869;21.2200091;20.9725575;male;30.6526004;29.4900592;two;34.2904003;32.3870439;28.7676768;38.5586466;35.8688182;24.6803977;28.0541885;31.9041585;25.0761931;32.5293361;one;asian;black;44.3563644;34.8131521;31.2819081;Whole blood;39.1940878;Whole blood_activity_tertile_two;25.9996414;23.6801591;30.052592;29.1943418

However, development of the intestinal circadian clock and detailed molecular mechanisms regulating circadian physiology of the intestine remain largely unknown. The lack of appropriate human model systems that enable organ- and/or diseasespecific interrogation of clock functions is a major obstacle hindering advancements of translational applications using chronotherapy. In this report, we show that both pluripotent stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids engrafted into mice and patient-derived human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) possess robust circadian rhythms, and demonstrate circadian phase-dependent necrotic cell death responses to Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB). Intriguingly, mouse and human enteroids demonstrate anti-phasic necrotic cell death responses. RNA-Seq data show ~4% of genes are rhythmically expressed in HIEs. Remarkably, we observe anti-phasic gene expression of Rac1, a small GTPase directly inactivated by TcdB, between mouse and human enteroids. Importantly, the observed circadian time-dependent necrotic cell death response is abolished in both mouse enteroids and human intestinal organoids (HIOs) lacking robust circadian rhythms. Our findings uncover robust functions of circadian rhythms regulating critical clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in human enteroids governing organism-specific, circadian phasedependent necrotic cell death responses. Our data highlight unique differences between mouse and human enteroids, and lay a foundation for human organ- and disease-specific investigation of clock functions using human organoids for translational applications.

Here we show that T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in Treg cells induces the nuclear translocation of Stk4, leading to the formation of a Stk4/NF-b p65/Foxp3 complex that regulates Foxp3 and p65-dependent transcriptional programs. The formation of this complex was stabilized by Stk4-dependent phosphorylation of Foxp3 serine 418. Stk4 deficiency in Treg cells, either alone or in synergy with that of its homologue Stk3, precipitated a fatal autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease characterized by decreased Treg cell p65 expression and nuclear translocation, impaired NF-b p65/Foxp3 complex formation and defective Treg cell activation. In an adoptive immunotherapy model, over-expression of p65 or the phosphomimetic Foxp3S418E in Stk3/4-deficient Treg cells ameliorated their immune regulatory defects. Our studies identify Stk3/4 as an essential TCR-responsive regulator of p65-Foxp3-dependent transcription that promotes Treg cell-mediated immune tolerance.		A;B;spleen;Het;Treg cells;WT
GSE178965	2021.09.01	Homo sapiens	GPL18460	TRUE	FALSE	19	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Gene expression profiling of newly-diagnosed DLBCL samples with RNA sequencing	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common B-cell malignancy with varying prognosis after the gold standard rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Several prognostic models have been established by focusing primarily on characteristics of lymphoma cells themselves, including cell-of-origin, genomic alterations, and gene/protein expressions. However, the prognostic impact of the lymphoma microenvironment and its association with characteristics of lymphoma cells are not fully understood. Using highly-sensitive transcriptome profiling of untreated DLBCL tissues, we here assess the clinical impact of lymphoma microenvironment on the clinical outcomes and pathophysiological, molecular signatures in DLBCL. The presence of normal germinal center (GC)-microenvironmental cells, including follicular T cells, macrophage/dendritic cells, and stromal cells, in lymphoma tissue indicates a positive therapeutic response. Our prognostic model, based on quantitation of transcripts from distinct GC-microenvironmental cell markers, clearly identified patients with graded prognosis independently of existing prognostic models. We observed increased incidences of genomic alterations and aberrant gene expression associated with poor prognosis in DLBCL tissues lacking GC-microenvironmental cells relative to those containing these cells. These data suggest that the loss of GC-associated microenvironmental signature dictates clinical outcomes of DLBCL patients reflecting the accumulation of “unfavorable” molecular signatures.

Here we report the initial experience, including safety, feasibility and laboratory proof-of-principle, with the collection and analysis of research specimens obtained via breast core needle biopsy immediately following routine clinical biopsy at a single institution over a 14-month period. Study eligibility criteria consisted of patients age 18 or older who were undergoing a clinical breast needle biopsy. Patients providing informed consent underwent one or two additional core biopsies following collection of all necessary clinical specimens. In total, 395 patients were approached and 270 consented to the research study, yielding a 68.4% consent rate. Among consenting patients, 238 lesions were biopsied for research, resulting in 446 research specimens collected. No immediate complications were observed. During the same period, zero complications were reported among the non-research procedures (1622 breast biopsy procedures). Representative research core specimens showed high diagnostic concordance with clinical core biopsies. Flow cytometry demonstrated consistent recovery of hundreds to thousands of viable cells per research core. Among a group of HER2+ tumor research specimens, HER2 assessment by flow cytometry correlated highly with immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and in addition revealed extensive inter- and intra-tumoral variation in HER2 levels of potential clinical relevance. Suitability for single-cell transcriptomic analysis was demonstrated for a triple-negative tumor core biopsy, revealing substantial cellular diversity in the tumor immune microenvironment, including a prognostically relevant T cell subpopulation. Thus, collection of fresh tissues for research purposes at the time of diagnostic breast biopsy is safe, feasible and efficient, and may provide a high-yield mechanism to generate a rich tissue repository for a wide variety of cross-disciplinary research.		treatment-naïve;human breast

To explore this at the single cell level, we isolated cells by ACSA2 MACS from the diencephalon. Single cell RNA-seq revealed two super clusters of cells expressing astrocyte markers, one of which expressed many ependymal markers. Fluorescent labelling of ependymal cells allowed removing them during dissection. The remaining astrocytes and astrocyte-like cells show considerable heterogeneity with some subsets or gene expression states showing more wide-spread and others more restricted mapping of gene expression throughout the forebrain. Surprisingly, diencephalic astrocytes express proliferation regulating genes. Immunostaining for proiliferation markers, DNA-base incorporation and clonal analysis revealed ongoing low level astrocytogenesis even in 8 months old mice. Comparing gene expression of astrocytes in diencephalon and cortex grey matter identified Smad4 as a key regulator of astrocyte in vivo proliferation and in vitro neurosphere formation.

Methods: RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and Reduced Representation Oxidative Bisulfite Sequencing (RRoxBS) analyses were done in total RNA and DNA obtained from micro-dissected cartilage at 4 and 12 weeks after DMM surgery. Murine and human primary chondrocytes were used to evaluate the cytokine- and methylation-dependent changes in the expression of Lrrc15, and its contribution to IL-1beta-induced changes in chondrocytes. Results: We identified time-dependent alterations in epigenomic patterns in cartilage after DMM, with significant changes in 5mC and 5hmC methylation comparing samples retrieved at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery. Integration of RNAseq and RRoxBS datasets identified Lrrc15 as a hypomethylated gene with increased expression at 4 weeks after surgery. We confirmed LRRC15 immunostaining in OA cartilage, and experiments in human and murine primary chondrocytes showed that the expression of Lrrc15 is DNA methylation-dependent and induced by IL1beta and TNFalfa in vitro. Knockdown experiments showed that Lrrc15 contributes to the IL1beta-driven expression of catabolic genes relevant to OA, including Mmp13. Significance: Our integrative analyses showed that the structural progression of OA is accompanied by transcriptomic and dynamic epigenomic changes in articular cartilage. We found that Lrrc15 is differentially methylated and expressed in OA cartilage, and that it may contribute to the cytokine-driven responses of OA chondrocytes. A better understanding of the role of Lrrc15 in cartilage homeostasis and osteoarthritis may help us uncover targets with therapeutic potential.

GSE175424	2021.09.01	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			CRAC channel controls the differentiation of pathogenic B cells in lupus nephritis	Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is a prototype of autoimmune disease. Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious complications of SLE. The development of autoreactive B cells and the production of autoantibodies have been critical for the initiation and progression of LN. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is the main Ca2+ influx pathway in lymphocytes and is essential for immune response . SOCE is mediated by Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels which are comprised of stromal interaction molecule (STIM) and calcium release-activated calcium modulators (ORAI) . Mutations in genes encoding the CRAC channel abolish SOCE in cells of the immune system and cause severe combined immunodeficiency . Calcium signaling via ORAI1 has been involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases by driving Th17 differentiation . STIM1 deficiency significantly reduced Th1/Th17 responses and resulted in complete protection from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis . Compared to T cells, the roles of CRAC channel in B cells is far less clear. Ca²⁺/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase2 (CaMK2) is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that is regulated by the Ca²⁺/CaM complex. CaMK2 has been involved in many signaling pathways and is necessary for Ca²⁺ homeostasis, T cell development and activation. CaMK4, another member of the CaMK family, has been shown to compromises podocyte function and promote renal diseases in LN. In the current study, we found that CRAC channel mediated calcium signaling is enhanced in B cells from patients with LN. CRAC channel inhibition by YM-58483 and knocked down of CRAC channel by ORAI1 or STIM2 siRNA led to suppression of CaMK2 signaling and decreased B cell differentiation. Lupus mice treated with CRAC channel inhibitor showed reduced anti-double stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA), decreased immune deposition in the glomeruli and improved renal function. CRAC channel mediates the development and progression of LN by promoting the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells.		treated with vehicle;treated with 20nm YM-58483;treated with 20nm YM-58484;treated with 20nm YM-58485;Naïve B cell;peripheral blood;naive B cell

Their primary mechanism of action occurs via neuroprotective effects by trophic factors, anti-inflammatory effects, and immunomodulation. However, the regeneration of damaged neuronal networks by cell transplantation remains still challenging. We hypothesized that cells induced to neural lineages would fit the niche, replace the lesion, and be more effective in improving symptoms compared with stem cells themselves. We investigated the characteristics of induced neural cells from human dental pulp tissue and compared the transplantation effects between these induced neural cells and uninduced dental pulp stem cells. Induced neural cells or dental pulp stem cells were intracerebrally transplanted 5 days after cerebral infarction induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in immunodeficient mice. Effects on functional recovery were also assessed through behavior testing. We used immunohistochemistry and neuron tracing to analyze the differentiation, axonal extension, and connectivity of transplanted cells to the host’s neural circuit. Transplantation of induced neural cells from human dental pulp ameliorated functional recovery after cerebral infarction compared with dental pulp stem cells. The induced neural cells comprised both neurons and glia and expressed functional voltage, and they were more related to neurogenesis in terms of transcriptomics. Induced neural cells had a higher viability than did dental pulp stem cells in hypoxic culture. We showed that induced neural cells from dental pulp tissue offer a novel therapeutic approach for recovery after cerebral infarction.		dental pulp;cultured cell

Here, we used scRNA-seq analysis to uncover the importance of respiration for extracellular matrix homeostasis in mature cartilage. A combined approach of high-resolution single cell RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry/matrisome analysis and atomic force microscopy was applied to mutant mice with cartilage-specific inactivation of respiratory chain function. Genetic inhibition of respiration in cartilage results in the expansion of a central area of 1-month-old mouse femur head cartilage showing disorganized chondrocytes and increased deposition of extracellular matrix material. scRNA-seq analysis identified a cluster-specific decrease in mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory chain genes and a unique regulation of extracellular matrix-related genes in nonarticular chondrocyte clusters. These changes were associated with alterations in extracellular matrix composition, a shift in the collagen/non-collagen protein content and an increase of collagen crosslinking and ECM stiffness. The results demonstrate, based on findings of the scRNA-seq analysis, that respiration is a key factor contributing to ECM integrity and mechanostability in cartilage and presumably also in many other tissues.		isolated chondrocytes from femur head cartilage of Col2Cre mice;isolated chondrocytes from femur head cartilage of Col2CreTW mice;chondrocytes;mitochondria dysfunction;Col2Cre+, Twinkle transgene+;femur;Col2Cre transgene+;control

In this report, we identify the multifunctional RNA polymerase II transcription factor Elongin as a cofactor for ATF6α-dependent transcription activation. Biochemical studies reveal that Elongin functions at least in part by facilitating ATF6α-dependent loading of Mediator at the promoters and enhancers of ER stress response genes. Depletion of Elongin from cells leads to impaired transcription of ER stress response genes and to defects in the recruitment of Mediator and, in particular, its CDK8 kinase subunit. Taken together, these findings bring to light a new role for Elongin as a loading factor for Mediator during the ER stress response.		4H;300nM Thapsigargin;0H;HCT116;ON-TARGETplus Human ELOA siRNA-SMARTPool, Dharmacon L-005143-00;siSTABLE Non-targeting siRNA #1, Dharmacon D-001700-01

NTBI is taken up by hepatocytes and other parenchymal cells via NTBI transporters and can cause cellular damage by promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, how NTBI affects endothelial cells, the most proximal cell type exposed to circulating NTBI, has not been explored. We modeled in vitro the effects of systemic iron overload on endothelial cells by treating primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with NTBI (ferric ammonium citrate, FAC). Using an unbiased approach, we showed by RNA-Seq that iron loading alters lipid homeostasis in HUVECs by inducing SREBP2-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis. We also determined that FAC increased the susceptibility of HUVECs to apoptosis induced by TNFα. Moreover, we showed that cholesterol biosynthesis contributes to iron-potentiated apoptosis. Treating HUVECs with a cholesterol chelator hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin demonstrated that depletion of cholesterol was sufficient to rescue HUVECs from TNFa-induced apoptosis, even in the presence of FAC. Finally, we showed that FAC or cholesterol treatment modulated the TNFα pathway by inducing novel proteolytic processing of TNFR1 to a short isoform that localizes to lipid rafts. Our study raises the possibility that iron-mediated toxicity in human iron overload disorders is at least in part dependent on alterations in cholesterol metabolism in endothelial cells, increasing their susceptibility to apoptosis.

We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pregnant women who did and did not progress to active TB. Methods: We followed a cohort of pregnant Indian women with TB infection for one year postpartum, collecting blood at study entry, 6 weeks postpartum and active TB diagnosis. A prospective signature of risk was identified by comparing whole blood RNA sequencing data from women who developed active TB postpartum (cases) with those who remained healthy (controls). Results: We identified 9 cases and matched them to 18 controls by HIV status and gestational age. A gene set of risk was identified: Expression of KCNIP4 > 2.2 log CPM and S1PR4 < 7.3 log CPM indicated a high probability of developing active TB postpartum. SF3B4 (>4.3 log CPM) and PGAM1 (>6.6 log CPM) correctly classified postpartum cases and controls. Both pairs displayed high accuracy (AUC >0.9) and were unique from 36 published TB signatures.Conclusions: We identified two genes that prospectively differentiated pregnant women who developed active TB postpartum from those who did not. If validated, this signature could be useful in targeted TB prevention programs.		Pregnant;not pregnant not postpartum;HIV infected;whole blood;not infected;TB infected;not TB;Postpartum

Metformin and leucine individually have shown positive effects in skeletal muscle during atrophy conditions but have not been evaluated in combination nor under the conditions of disuse atrophy and recovery in aging. The purpose of this study was to determine if a dual treatment of metformin and leucine (MET+LEU) would prevent disuse-induced atrophy and/or promote muscle recovery in aged mice (22-24 mo). We were also interested if these muscle responses correspond to changes in satellite cells and ECM abundance. Aged mice were subjected to 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU) followed by 7 or 14 days of reloading (7 or 14d RL). Metformin (MET), leucine (LEU), or MET+LEU was administered via drinking water and were compared to Vehicle-treated mice. We observed that MET+LEU increased whole body grip strength, muscle specific force and satellite cell abundance during HU but did not alter muscle size during HU or RL. Moreover, MET+LEU treatment increased ECM turnover driven by a decrease in collagen IV   content during 7 and 14d RL. Transcriptome analysis revealed that MET+LEU altered Gene Set Enrichment Analysis hallmark pathways related to inflammation and myogenesis during HU. Together  , MET+LEU was able to improve muscle quality during disuse and recovery in aging possibly by increasing muscle satellite cell content and reducing excessive ECM accumulation.

Although high levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) accumulate in neurons, it is not known whether 5hmC can serve as an intermediate in DNA demethylation in postmitotic neurons. Here we report high resolution mapping of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, chromatin accessibility, and activating and repressive histone marks in developing postmitotic Purkinje cells (PCs). Our data reveal new relationships between PC transcriptional and epigenetic programs, and identify a class of late expressed genes that lose both 5mC and 5hmC during terminal differentiation. Deletion of the 5hmC writers Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 from postmitotic Purkinje cells prevents loss of 5mC and 5hmC in regulatory domains and gene bodies and hinders transcriptional and epigenetic developmental transitions, resulting in hyper-excitability and increased susceptibility to excitotoxic drugs. Our data demonstrate that Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation occurs in vivo, and that acquisition of the precise molecular and electrophysiological properties of adult PCs requires continued oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC during the final phases of differentiation.

Therapeutic targeting of injuries that require transient restoration of proteins by mRNA delivery is an attractive aspect, however until recently, it has remained poorly explored. In this study, we examined for the first time therapeutic utility of mRNA delivery in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which contributes to millions of deaths, annually. Here, demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of the human transcription factor hepatic nuclear factor alpha (HNF4A) encoding mRNA in murine chronically injured liver leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. We investigated restoration of hepatocyte functions by HNF4A mRNA transfection in vitro, and analyzed the attenuation of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in multiple mouse models, by delivering hepatocyte-targeted biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (LNP) encapsulating HNF4A mRNA. To identify potential mechanism, we performed microarray-based gene expression profiling, single cell RNA sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We used primary liver cells and human liver buds for further functional validation. Expression of HNF4A encoding mRNA led to restoration of metabolic activity of fibrotic primary murine and human hepatocytes in vitro. Repeated in vivo delivery of HNF4A mRNA encapsulated-LNP induced a robust inhibition of fibrogenesis in four independent mouse models of hepatotoxin- and cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, we discovered that paraoxonase 1 is a direct target of HNF4A and it contributes to HNF4A-mediated attenuation of liver fibrosis via modulation of liver macrophages and hepatic stellate cells. Collectively, our findings provide the first direct preclinical evidence of the applicability of HNF4A mRNA therapeutics for the treatment of fibrosis in the liver.

Due to difficulty in accessing pancreas tissues, little is known about local immune responses in human CP. Here we attempted to uncover the disease-specific immune responses in pancreata from two different etiologies of CP (hereditary and idiopathic CP) compared with those from non-diseased controls by using CITE-seq and scTCR-seq. Methods: We performed cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-Seq) and T cell receptor sequencing of pancreatic immune cells isolated from organ donors (n=3) and CP patients (Hereditary CP, n=5; Idiopathic CP, n=4) who underwent total pancreatectomy. Results: Deep single-cell sequencing revealed distinct immune characteristics and a significantly enriched CCR6+ CD4+ T cells in hereditary compared with idiopathic CP. In hereditary CP, a reduction in T cell clonality was observed due to the increased CD4+ T (Th) cells that replaced tissue resident CD8+ T cells. Lineage tracing analysis with scRNA/TCR-seq data also unveiled unique interactions between CCR6+ Th and Th1 subsets, and TCR clustering analysis showed unique common antigen binding motifs in hereditary CP. In addition, we observed a significant upregulation of the CCR6 ligand (CCL20) among monocytes in hereditary CP as compared with those in idiopathic CP. The functional significance of the CCR6 expression in CD4+ T cells was confirmed by flow cytometry and migration assay. Conclusions: Our approaches with integrative single-cell analyses unveiled distinct pancreatic immune signatures and pathways between different etiologies of CP. Our study specifically unveiled pancreas-specific immune crosstalks through a CCR6-CCL20 axis that might be leveraged as a potential future target in human hereditary CP		PRSS1;Chronic pancreatitis (Idiopathic);Chronic pancreatitis (Hereditary);PRSS1, CFTR, SPINK1;Male;Female;Pancreas;Immune cells;PRSS1, CFTR;None;-

These mutations target both known and new regulatory hotspots as well as transitional activation states of the protein. The most frequent VAV1 mutant subclass drives PTCL formation in mice by exacerbating normal VAV1- dependent signaling responses in follicular helper T cells.

Importantly, runner plasma reduces baseline neuroinflammatory gene expression and experimentally induced brain inflammation. Plasma proteomic analysis revealed a striking increase in complement cascade inhibitors including clusterin (CLU), which is facilitating the anti-inflammatory effects of runner plasma. Intravenously injected CLU strongly binds to brain endothelial cells reducing their inflammatory gene expression in an acute model of brain inflammation and in Alzheimer’s disease model mice.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to generate similar, or even greater, molecular changes in skeletal muscle as that of constant load longer-lasting endurance-type training at moderate intensities. Despite shorter exposure times, the higher intensity provided by HIIT training leads to greater metabolic perturbations and thereby larger improvements in mitochondrial content and maximal oxygen uptake. During a period of regular exercise training, the performance improvements follow a non-linear pattern with a relatively faster pace initially and a gradual ‘plateauing-off’ after weeks and months. It is believed that this ‘plateau effect’ is due to a blunting of the molecular responses to acute exercise with exercise training. In the present study we utilised an explorative global transcriptomic approach to investigate the phenomenon of transcriptional-level blunting of the acute exercise response in human skeletal muscle over the course of a three-week HIIT intervention. We hypothesize that the blunting of transcription at this time-point is specific to certain pathways, including metabolic regulation and that these genes have communal transcriptional regulation.

While animal studies suggest SGLT2i improve cardiac metabolism, the effect of SGLT2i on mitochondrial function in the heart is not known. Our goal was to assess the effects of SGLT2i on mitochondrial function, high energy phosphates and genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in hearts of mice with and without diet-induced diabetes. Methods & Results: Ertugliflozin (Ertu; formulated to 0.5 mg/g of diet) was given for 4 months to mice fed a high fat, high sucrose (HFHS) diet that causes diabetic cardiomyopathy or control diet (CD). Mitochondrial function was measured in isolated cardiac mitochondria. Myocardial energetics were assessed by NMR spectroscopy simultaneously with systolic function in isolated beating hearts. Myocardial gene expression was assessed by RNA seq using gene set enrichment analysis. HFHS diet caused myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction (decreased ATP production, increased reactive oxygen species release) and an impaired energetic response to increased work demand - all of which were prevented by Ertu. Conctractile function, as reflected by the rate x pressure product (RPP), was super-normalized to a value 124% of CD hearts at high work demand. In control mice, Ertu had no effect on isolated mitochondria function or high energy phosphates, but similar to HFHS hearts, caused super-normalization of RPP to 125% of CD hearts. By GSEA the highest scoring gene set for Ertu treatment was oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which was up-regulated across all groups while controlling for diet with a Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) of +3.71, and was similarly up-regulated in HFHS-fed mice (NES, +3.32) and in CD-fed mice (NES, +3.34). Fatty acid metabolism (FAM) was the second-highest scoring gene set for Ertu, and, like OXPHOS, was up-regulated independent of diet (NES, +2.82). Conclusion: The super-normalization of contractile function and induction of the OXPHOS and FAM gene sets by Ertu are independent of diabetic status. Pro-metabolic remodeling of the myocardium by Ertu may support increased contractile function and contribute to the beneficial actions of Ertu in states such as heart failure that are associated with impaired cardiac mitochondrial function.		untreated;high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFHS);HFHS ertugliflozin;ertugliflozin;HFHS untreated;CD ertugliflozin;control diet (CD);CD untreated;left ventricle of heart
GSE161566	2021.09.01	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE	GSE179028		Ontogeny and function of the circadian clock in intestinal organoids [human]	Circadian rhythms regulate diverse aspects of gastrointestinal physiology ranging from the composition of microbiota to motility. However, development of the intestinal circadian clock and detailed molecular mechanisms regulating circadian physiology of the intestine remain largely unknown. The lack of appropriate human model systems that enable organ- and/or diseasespecific interrogation of clock functions is a major obstacle hindering advancements of translational applications using chronotherapy. In this report, we show that both pluripotent stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids engrafted into mice and patient-derived human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) possess robust circadian rhythms, and demonstrate circadian phase-dependent necrotic cell death responses to Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB). Intriguingly, mouse and human enteroids demonstrate anti-phasic necrotic cell death responses. RNA-Seq data show ~4% of genes are rhythmically expressed in HIEs. Remarkably, we observe anti-phasic gene expression of Rac1, a small GTPase directly inactivated by TcdB, between mouse and human enteroids. Importantly, the observed circadian time-dependent necrotic cell death response is abolished in both mouse enteroids and human intestinal organoids (HIOs) lacking robust circadian rhythms. Our findings uncover robust functions of circadian rhythms regulating critical clock-controlled genes (CCGs) in human enteroids governing organism-specific, circadian phasedependent necrotic cell death responses. Our data highlight unique differences between mouse and human enteroids, and lay a foundation for human organ- and disease-specific investigation of clock functions using human organoids for translational applications.

RNA-seq analysis not only confirmed the imbalance of proliferation and differentiation in the DKO retina but also revealed Zfp36l1 and Zfp36l2 interact with multiple signaling pathways including the sonic hedgehog pathway and the Notch pathway, to regulate this process.

Here we examined cell fate in the absence of de novo DNA methyltransferases. We found that embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are rapidly eliminated from chimaeras. Pluripotency progression is derailed towards extra-embryonic trophoblast. This aberrant trajectory is propelled by failure to methylate and suppress expression of Ascl2 during formative transition. Ascl2 deletion rescues transition and improves contribution to chimaeric epiblast but mutant cells are progressively lost in later development.

We augmented our IVF mouse model to longitudinally investigate cardiometabolic outcomes in offspring from optimal neonatal litter sizes. We found that IVF-conceived females had higher body weight and cholesterol levels compared to naturally-conceived females, whereas IVF-conceived males had higher levels of triglycerides and insulin, and increased body fat composition. Through transcriptomics and proteomics of adult liver, we identified sexually-dimorphic dysregulation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathways that contribute to the sex-specfic phenotypes. We also found that global loss of DNA methylation in placenta was linked to higher cholesterol levels in IVF-conceived females. Our findings indicate that IVF procedures have long-lasting sex-specific effects on metabolic health of offspring and lay the foundation to utilize the placenta as a predictor of long-term outcomes.

Therefore, new anti-leukemia treatments and mouse models are needed for this combinatorial AML genotype. For this purpose, we first generated a Bcor-/- knock-out mouse model characterized by impaired erythroid development (macrocytosis and anemia) and enhanced thrombopoiesis, which are both features of myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative neoplasms. We then created and characterized double Bcor-/-/Dnmt3a-/- knock-out mice. Interestingly, these animals developed a fully penetrant acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) characterized by leukocytosis secondary to the expansion of blasts expressing c-Kit+ and the erythroid marker Ter119, macrocytic anemia and progressive reduction of the thrombocytosis associated with loss of Bcor alone. Transcriptomic analysis of double knock-out bone marrow progenitors revealed that aberrant erythroid skewing was induced by epigenetic changes affecting specific transcriptional factors (GATA1-2) and cell-cycle regulators (Mdm2, Tp53). These findings prompted us to investigate the efficacy of demethylating agents in AEL, with significant impact on progressive leukemic burden and mice overall survival. Information gained from our model expands the knowledge on the biology of AEL and may help designing new rational treatments for patients suffering from this high-risk leukemia.

Cleavage fragments (CF) are chemically identical to asbestiform varieties of parent mineral, but there is no consensus on whether to treat them as asbestos from toxicological and regulatory standpoints. Alveolar macrophages (AM) are the first-responders to inhaled particulates, participating in clearance, and activating the other resident and recruited immunocompetent cells, which has an impact on the long-term outcomes. In the current study we addressed the question of how asbestiform vs. non-asbestiform EMPs affect AM responses. Max Planck Institute (MPI) cells, a non-transformed mouse line that has AM phenotype and genotype, were treated with surface area-equivalent concentrations of respirable asbestiform and non-asbestiform riebeckite/tremolite EMPs for 24h. Detectable changes in macrophage gene expression happen within 6-24 hours post-stimuli (Schneider et al., 2019), thus we performed the next generation RNA sequencing of the MPI cells 24 hours post exposure to surface area-equivalent doses of riebeckite and tremolite EMPs to see if AM immediate transcriptional reprogramming patterns are intrinsic for different minerals and/or crystallization habit.		5 µg/cm^2 tremolite asbestos;cell culture;40 µg/cm^2 riebeckite cleavage fragments;C57BL6/J;fetal liver;none;9 µg/cm^2 riebeckite asbestos;female;60 µg/cm^2 tremolite cleavage fragments

Compromised insulatory function of myelin was due to the complete loss of paranodal axoglial junctions flanking the nodes of Ranvier. By contrast, the paranodal junctions in the CNS oligodendrocytes are unaltered upon deletion of TDP-43. Mechanistically, TDP-43 binds directly to Nfasc mRNA, which encodes neurofascin, a key cell adhesion molecule essential for establishing paranodal junctions. TDP-43 binding sites overlap with a cryptic exon of Nfasc such that loss of TDP-43 leads to the retention of this cryptic exon with a premature stop codon, a prerequisite for nonsense-mediated decay. Thus, TDP-43 is required for the proper assembly of nodes of Ranvier that is essential for saltatory conduction by suppressing the cryptic exon in the Nfasc mRNA of the Schwann cells. Our findings indicate a direct involvement of TDP-43 in normal PNS function and suggest that PNS-autonomous dysfunction in saltatory conduction may contribute to TDP-43 proteinopathies.

Transcriptome analysis of submandibular glands in female MyD88+/+ and MyD88−/− NOD mice. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by dysfunction of salivary glands (SGs) and lacrimal glands, which is caused by chronic inflammation associated with autoantibody and autoreactive lymphocyte infiltration. The pathogenic mechanism of SS has not been fully elucidated. Infiltrated lymphocytes form regularized structures similar to lymphoid follicles of secondary lymphoid organs, such as T/B cell compartments, high endothelial venules (HEVs), lymphatic vessels, and germinal centers, therefore being believed as an ectopic lymphoid tissue called tertiary lymphoid organs (TLO). We previously found that deletion of the Toll-like receptor/IL-1 receptor (TLR/IL-1R) adaptor molecule gene Myd88 in SS model mice NOD reduced the frequency of lymphocyte infiltration and HEV formation in SGs. In this study, we analyzed the effect of MyD88 deficiency on lymphoid follicle formation in SGs of NOD mice. Microarray analysis showed decreased expression of genes related to TLO, such as Cxcl13 and Cxcr5, in Myd88-deficient SGs. These results indicate that deficiency of TLR/IL-1R signaling decrease gene expression ot chemokines in SGs, suggesting MyD88-dependent signaling is directly involved in formation of lymphoid follicles in SS.

Strikingly, the frequency of circulating Tfh is correlated with disease activity in SLE patients. As such, understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the aberrant Tfh cell generation and activation in lupus is of fundamental significance. We previously demonstrated that expanded Tfh cells in the B6.Sle1.Sle2.Sle3 (TC for triple congenic) lupus model exhibit high glycolysis and oxidative metabolism, which can be constrained by inhibiting glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). We performed RNA-seq analyses of splenic Tfh and naïve CD4+ T cells (Tn) comparing between TC and B6 mice. First, data revealed a large number of shared gene signatures in Tfh and Tn comparing between TC and B6 group, implicating that the aberrant development of Tfh initiates as early as Tn state. Further alignment of the Tfh transcriptome obtained from RNA-seq and earlier microarray assays demonstrated concerted alterations in numerous gene signatures of overactivation of T cells including dysregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MAPK signaling pathways. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) further revealed altered metabolic pathways (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation and pyruvate metabolism) among splenic TC Tfh cells.

Cancer stem cells contribute to metastasis in the murine colon cancer models, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we report a Wnt ligand, Dickkopf2 (DKK2) is essential for colorectal cancer stemness. Genetic depletion of Dkk2 in intestinal epithelial or stem cells reduced tumorigenesis as well as expression of the stem cell marker gene Lgr5 in a model of colitis-associated cancer. Mechanistically, DKK2 activates c-Src followed by increased LGR5 expressing stem cells in colorectal cancer through degradation of HNF4α1. Splenic injection of DKK2-deficient cancer organoids into C57BL/6 mice resulted in a significant reduction of liver metastases compared to the control cancer organoids in spite of the presence of oncogenic mutations in Apc, Kras and Tp53 genes. These findings suggest that DKK2 is required for stemness of colorectal cancer cells, which in turn contributes to metastasis.

GSE157601	2021.09.01	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	13	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Transcriptomic analyses of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of gynecologic origin	High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) of the cervix are rare, aggressive cancers accounting for about 1-1.5% of all cervical cancer. The 5-year survival is up to 36% for early-stage disease; however, the advanced-stage disease has <10% survival, with relapse rates exceeding 90%. These cancers are likely to have a vascular invasion and nodal or visceral metastasis. Unfortunately, NEC of the cervix affects young women with a median age of 37. High-grade NECs of other gynecologic origins are even rarer, share similar aggressive behavior and poor outcomes. We performed stranded paired-end RNA-seq of 13 samples, including 12 samples with matched whole exome sequencing (WES) data. Sites of origin for tumors in our cohort were the cervix (69%), ovary (19%), and endometrium (12%). The median number of prior lines of therapy was 1. Median PFS and OS were 1 and 12 months, respectively, indicating their highly lethal nature. Comparing transcriptomic profiles with TCGA cervical and ovarian cancers, chromatin assembly and nucleosome organization were the top GO functions for significantly over-expressed genes in our cohort. Remarkably, under-expressed genes in our cohort were enriched for protein modification and catabolic processes, and neutrophil-mediated immunity. Compared to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), our cohort showed highly distinct transcriptomic patterns, and represented the YAP1 high molecular subtype.

This effect is inderectly mediated by hematopoietic stem cell niches in the bone marrow because hematopoietic cells do not express the Osmr gene whereas bone marrow endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells forming niches do. We find tha tOsmr deletion in the niche increases hematopoietic stem cells chemotaxis to CXCL12 and quiescence while decreasing E-selectin expression on bone marrow endothelial cells.

Objective: Using a murine in vitro model of early germ cell specification and differentiation, we sought to assess whether exposure to low levels of BPA prior to Primordial Germ Cell (PGC) formation alters their differentiation trajectory and unique molecular program. Methods: We used an established method of in vitro differentiation of mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) into Epiblast-like Cells (EpiLCs) followed by PGC-Like Cells (PGCLCs) which together recapitulates defined stages of early germ cell development. Cellular consequences were determined using hemocytometer-based cell counting, fixation and intracellular staining followed by flow cytometry/FACS on cells exposed to increasing doses of BPA. We also generated RNA-seq libraries from RNA extracted from FACS-purified PGCLCs and performed transcriptome analysis using bioinformatics-based approaches, to interrogate and characterise gene expression changes resulting from BPA exposure. Results: Exposure of EpiLCs to BPA resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cell number, associated with an increase proportion of cells in S-phase as well as a reduced proportion undergoing apoptosis. Exposure also resulted in a greater proportion of EpiLCs showing signs of DNA damage. Remarkably, EpiLC exposure did not negatively impact PGC specification and resulted in dose-dependent increase in PGCLC proliferation. However, PGCLC transcriptome analysis revealed an aberrant program with significant deregulation of X-linked genes and retrotransposon expression. Differential gene expression analysis also revealed the deregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism as well as deregulated expression of genes associated with later stages of gametogenesis. Conclusions: Our findings represent the first characterisation of the consequences of early BPA exposure on a model of PGC development, highlighting altered cell behaviour and underlying pathways and molecular processes.

Although the cellular response to mild stress has been intensively studied, the response to severe stress remains unclear. We show here that under severe stress conditions, cells induce transient hibernation-like mechanisms in anticipation of recovery, which we have termed the Adaptive Pausing Response (APR). The APR is a coordinated cellular response that limits ATP supply and consumption processes via severe mitochondrial fragmentation and inhibits mRNA translation initiation by induction of ribosome pausing at translation initiation codons, respectively. During recovery from severe stress, cells exhibited adaptive ISR signaling, which permitted cell cycle progression, resumption of growth, and reversal of mitochondria fragmentation. We propose that the APR preserves vital elements of cellular function in response to severe environmental stress, and likely plays a major role in homeostasis and pathogenesis.

Based on 103,264 single-cell transcriptomes, we identified 333 cell types in 19 tissue types. We characterized expression patterns of five major signaling pathways that are extensively involved in vertebrate embryonic patterning. We further reconstructed spatial axes in neural progenitors and demonstrated the conservation between human and mouse neural cell types. We defined precise domains for limb mesenchymal cells and provided a thorough characterization of dynamic gene expression during limb patterning. Finally, we revealed the differentiation process of retina development when combined with published data on later human development. Our study provides a compendium of early progenitor cells of human organs, which can serve as basis of lineage analysis in organogenesis as well as benchmarks for iPS and ESC-based in vitro induction systems.		embryo1-lower trunk and viscera;embryo5-viscera;embryo3-head;Male;embryo3-limb and viscera;embryo limb;embryo limb and viscera;embryo4-head;embryo2-limb;embryo head;Female;embryo3-trunk;embryo trunk;embryo2-trunk;Carnegie Stages 13;embryo2-head;Carnegie Stages 12;embryo viscera;embryo1-head and upper trunk;embryo4-limb;embryo head and upper trunk;embryo5-limb and viscera;Carnegie Stages 15-16;embryo4-trunk;embryo lower trunk and viscera;embryo2-viscera

Despite the importance of ESG in the regulation of BBB permeability in physiological conditions and in diseases, this is an underresearched area. Microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices allow the study of BBB properties in dynamic conditions. We studied a BBB model, human endothelial cells derived from hematopoetic stem cells in co-culture with brain pericytes, in an LOC device to understand the role of fluid flow in the regulation of ESG-related genes and surface charge. The MACE gene sequencing study showed differentially expressed core protein genes of the ESG after fluid flow, as well as enriched pathways for the extracellular matrix molecules. We observed increased barrier properties, a higher intensity glycocalyx staining and a more negative surface charge of human brain ECs in dynamic conditions. Our study is the first to provide data on ESG of human ECs in an LOC device under dynamic conditions and confirm the importance of fluid flow for BBB culture models.

KCs are also able to present antigen to CD8+ T cells and promote either T cell tolerance or full effector differentiation, but the mechanisms underlying these discrepant outcomes are poorly understood. Here, we used a mouse model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection – where HBV-specific naïve CD8+ T cells recognizing hepatocellular antigens are driven into a state of immune dysfunction – to identify a subset of KCs (referred to as KC2) that improves the antiviral function of T cells upon exogenous administration of IL-2. Mechanistically, KC2 were found to be both enriched in the IL-2 sensing machinery and poised to productively cross-present hepatocellular antigens in response to this cytokine. Removing MHC-I from all KCs – including KC2 – as well as selectively depleting KC2 impaired the capacity of IL-2 to revert the T cell dysfunction induced by intrahepatic priming. Together, these findings indicate that, by sensing IL-2 and cross-presenting hepatocellular antigens, KC2 overcome the tolerogenic potential of the hepatic microenvironment and suggest new strategies for boosting T cell immunity in the liver.		untreated;PBS;Kupffer Cells 2;Kupffer Cells 1;Kupffer Cells;Kupffer Cells PBS;Kupffer Cells with low ESAM and CD206 cell surface markers;C57BL/6;IL2;Kupffer Cells IL2;Kupffer Cells with high ESAM and CD206 cell surface markers

We selected 14 chemicals based on their risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and tested them in hepatocytes at two treatment concentrations. HTTr data was generated using the TempO-Seq whole transcriptome and S1500+ assays. The HTTr platform exhibited high reproducibility between technical replicates (r>0.9) but biological replication was greater for TempO-Seq S1500+ (r>0.85) than for the whole transcriptome (r>0.7). Reproducibility between biological replicates was dependent on the strength of transcriptional effects induced by a chemical treatment. Despite targeting a smaller number of genes, the S1500+ assay clustered chemical treatments and produced gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) scores comparable to those of the whole transcriptome. Connectivity mapping showed a high-level of reproducibility between TempO-Seq data and Affymetrix GeneChip data from the Open TG-GATES project with high concordance between the S1500+ gene set and whole transcriptome. Taken together, our results provide guidance on selecting the number of technical and biological replicates and support the use of TempO-Seq S1500+ assay for a high-throughput platform for screening hepatotoxicants.

Amplification of the oncogene MYCN is strongly associated with highly malignant behaviour and poor prognosis. Here, we used human ESC-derived neural crest model to recapitulate the initiation of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma and to identify MYCN downstream effectors. Our results show that induced deregulation of MYCN in human neural crest progenitor cells is sufficient to induce tumors that recapitulate the pathological and molecular features of human MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma(MNA-NB). By using this platform, we are able to identify a group of 28 genes that are associated with MYCN expression level only in MNA-NB.

In this study we investigated the potential nuclear functions of PRC1 and the consequences of overexpression of PRC1 by using lung cancer cell lines stably expressing inducible expression constructs for PRC1. Ectopically expressed PRC1 resulted in proliferation defects, multi-nucleation and enlargement of cells which were directly linked to microtubule-bundling within the cytoplasm. Genome wide expression profiling by RNA sequencing revealed that the p53 pathway is activated upon overexpression of PRC1 resulting in cellular senescence. A mutant of PRC1 unable to enter into the nucleus induced the same gene sets as wildtype PRC1, suggesting that PRC1 has no nuclear-specific functions in lung cancer cells. The depletion of p53 switched the response to PRC1 overexpression or depletion from senescence to apoptosis. In addition, treatment with cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug, enhanced the proliferation defects due to deregulated PRC1, implicating PRC1 as a possible therapeutic target for cancer. Taken together, PRC1 needs to be tightly regulated to allow unperturbed proliferation of lung cancer cells.		A549 cells;NLS3A-mutant;lung epithelial carcinoma cells;induced;non-induced;wildtype

We performed a detailed characterization of host mRNA responses to RV infection in human precision cut lung tissue ex vivo (comparing to previously published asthma and COPD studies) and explored the impact of antiviral treatment. Genomic analyses revealed that RV not only induced anti-viral immune responses but also triggered changes in epithelial cell-associated pathways. Strikingly, the RV response in PCLS was reflective of gene expression changes described previously in COPD and asthma patients. While RV-induced host immune responses were abrogated by rupintrivir, RV-triggered epithelial processes were largely refractory to antiviral treatment.

However, a portion of terminal 4q deletions with CHD do not include known CHD genes. Here in a target sequencing of a panel of known and candidate CHD genes, we showed that the detrimental rare variants of SORBS2 in 4q35.1 are significantly enriched in CHD patients. Examination of Sorbs2-/- mouse hearts revealed two types of atrial septal defects (ASD), atrial hypoplasia/aplasia and double atrial septum. In vitro human cardiogenesis indicated a dual role of SORBS2 in maintaining sarcomeric integrity of cardiomyocytes and specifying the fate of cardiac progenitors. Mechanistically, SORBS2 promotes the commitment of the second heart field (SHF) over the first heart field (FHF) fate through c-ABL/NOTCH/SHH axis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that SORBS2 is a novel CHD gene within deleted 4q interval. The presence of double atrial septum in Sorbs2-/- mouse reveals the first molecular etiology of the rare anomaly linked to paradoxical thromboembolism.		cardiac progenitor cells;ES-derived cardiac progenitor cells;8-13

SETD2 is frequently mutated in multiple cancers and acts as a tumor suppressor. Here, utilizing a liver-specific deletion of Setd2 mice model, we found that Setd2 depletion is sufficient to trigger hepatocarcinoma (HCC) spontaneously. Meanwhile, in a DEN-induced HCC model, Setd2 depletion significantly promoted tumor number and size. The mechanistic study showed that Setd2 suppresses HCC not only through modulating DNA damage response, but also regulating lipid metabolism in liver. Setd2 deficiency down-regulated the expression of cholesterol efflux genes and caused lipid accumulation. ChIP-Seq analysis further revealed that Setd2 deletion induced AP-1 activation in liver, which was probably trigged by accumulated cholesterol. AP-1 is a well-known oncogene in HCC and inhibits p53 in Setd2-deficient cells. Taken together, we found the role of an important epigenetic gene in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and HCC, and revealed the underlying mechanisms.		8-month;intraperitoneal injection with DEN;Setd2 wild type liver tumor;liver tumor;Setd2 knockout;Setd2 knockout normal liver tissue;Setd2 knockout liver tumor;normal liver tissue;Setd2 wild type;Setd2 wild type normal liver tissue;none

We used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the effects of anti–PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) durvalumab (D) alone and combined with an anti–CTLA-4 mAb, tremelimumab (T), on distinct subsets of immune cells. Upon treatment with D or D+T, two NSCLC tumors showed elevated IFNγ responses, although they differed in magnitude of response but differed in other areas. Our results highlight that D and D+T in the TME have some consistent effects across tumors but also exhibit tumor-specific effects depending on composition and functional state of immune cells in the TME at time of treatment. This complex tumor-specific interplay of diverse immune subtypes in the TME is critical to better understand patient response to immunotherapy.		NSCLC tumor;Durva+Treme;Durva;needle biopsy

Indeed, siPI4KIIIβ-transfected H23 and H2122 lung cancer cell lines demonstrated evidence of apoptosis on the basis of western blotting, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing, which identified 717 genes up-regulated in shPI4KIIIβ-transfected H23 cells (fold-change > 1.4, P-value < 0.01 by t-test, false discovery rate<10%) that were enriched in, among other Gene Ontology terms, “positive regulation of apoptotic process” (20 genes, P=0.005), “extracellular matrix” (18 genes, P=1.3E-05), and “extracellular matrix organization” (29 genes, P=1.8E-06) (one-sided Fisher’s exact test using Gene Ontology terms). To determine whether apoptosis resulted from impairment of PI4KIIIβ-dependent secretion, we performed conditioned media transfer experiments and found that the proliferative activity of shPI4KIIIβ-transfected cells was rescued by conditioned media from PI4KIIIβ-replete, but not -deficient, cells.

Here, genomic analysis of 42,793 cancers identified recurrent mutational hotspots in XPO1, the main nuclear export receptor in eukaryotic cells. Expression of XPO1 mutations in vivo was sufficient to initiate clonal, B-lymphoproliferative disorders by altering the constellation of proteins exported from the nucleus based on amino acid charge C-terminal to their nuclear export signal. Impaired export of one such protein, the NFkB inhibitor IB enhanced NFkB signaling, a pathway frequently activated by somatic mutations in cancers enriched in XPO1 mutations.

However, the role of histone modifications in the inheritance of acquired phenotypes remains largely unknown in mammals. Here, we report that gestational choline supplementation (GCS) in maternal mice exerts anxiolytic effects on male offspring across 2 generations. Correspondingly, GCS-induced H3K9 hyperacetylation in the Nr3c1 promoter in male hippocampus leads to upregulation of Nr3c1 and its encoded protein, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), across 2 generations through the male germline. Furthermore, inhibition of CREB-binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) function restored GCS-induced epigenetic and behavioral alterations, suggesting that CBP function as a HAT to increase Nr3c1 expression through H3K9 hyperacetylation. Thus, GCS-induced GR upregulation through CBP-mediated H3K9 hyperacetylation in the Nr3c1 promoter is associated with anxiolytic behavior in male offspring, highlighting the role of histone modification in acquired phenotypes across mammalian generations.

Following activation, T cells engage distinct metabolic programs leading to the uptake and processing of nutrients that determine cell proliferation and differentiation. Redirection of T cell fate by modulation of these metabolic programs has been shown to boost or suppress immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Using publicly available T cell transcriptomic and proteomic datasets we identified vitamin B6-dependent transaminases as key metabolic enzymes driving T cell activation and differentiation. Inhibition of vitamin B6 metabolism using the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) inhibitor, aminoxyacetic acid (AOA), suppresses CD8+ T cell proliferation and effector differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. We show that pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), a negative regulator of intracellular vitamin B6 levels, is under the control of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF1), a central driver of T cell metabolism. Furthermore, by adoptive transfer of CD8 T cells into a C57BL/6 mouse melanoma model, we demonstrate the requirement for vitamin B6-dependent enzyme activity in mediating effective anti-tumor responses. Our findings show that vitamin B6 metabolism is required for CD8+ T cell proliferation and effector differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Targeting vitamin B6 metabolism may therefore serve as an immunodulatory strategy to improve anti-tumor immunotherapy.		CD8+ T cells;vehicle (water);AOA 0.25mM

Broad knowledge about the genetics, epidemiology, and clinical management of T1D has been achieved, but the cell varieties in the bone marrow during T1D remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of whole bone marrow cells from healthy (group C) and STZ-induced T1D (group D) mice for the first time, presenting a profile of the bone marrow cells and revealing the changes in immune cells in bone marrow. The bone marrow cells in both groups C and D were divided into 12 clusters, and there were 249 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Compared with group C, the proportion of CD45+ immune cells in group D was not changed much. However, the diversity of CD45+ immune cells between groups C and D were greatly affected. There was a large increase in the proportion of bone marrow neutrophils (BM-neutrophils) and a large decrease in the proportion of B lymphocytes in group D. Furthermore, it was confirmed by X-ray and micro-CT analyses that osteopenia occurred in group D mice. Finally, we investigated the correlation between immune cells and osteopenia. The results of single-cell flow cytometry and correlation analysis showed that the ratio of BM-neutrophils/B lymphocytes was negatively correlated with osteopenia in T1D mice. Thus, precise regulation of the immune cells in the bone marrow may contribute to a better understanding of the treatment of T1D and the prevention of T1D-induced osteopenia.		sodium citrate solution;streptozotocin;control;high blood sugar;C57/BL6;bone marrow;femurs and tibias;normal blood sugar;Type 1 diabetes (T1D)

When analyzing these DCs in murine BM, we uncovered that they are localized around sinusoids, can (cross)-present antigens, become activated upon intravenous LPS-injection, and for the majority belong to the cDC2 subtype which is associated with Th2/Th17 immunity. Gene-expression profiling revealed that BM-resident DCs are enriched for several c-type lectins, including Dectin-1, which can bind beta-glucans expressed on fungi and yeast. Indeed, DCs in BM were much more efficient in phagocytosis of both yeast-derived zymosan-particles and Aspergillus than their splenic counterparts, which was highly dependent on Dectin-1. DCs in human BM could also phagocytose zymosan, which was dependent on β1-integrins. Moreover, zymosan-stimulated BM-resident DCs enhanced the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells towards neutrophils, while also boosting the maintenance of these progenitors. Our findings signify an important role for BM DCs as translators between infection and hematopoiesis, in particular in anti-fungal immunity. The ability of BM-resident DCs to boost granulopoiesis is relevant from a clinical perspective, and contributes to our understanding of the increased susceptibility for fungal infections following BM damage.

Tissue maintenance and repair depend on the integrated activity of multiple cell types. Whereas the contributions of epithelial, immune and stromal cells in intestinal tissue integrity are well understood, the role of intrinsic neuroglia networks remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover pivotal roles of enteric glial cells (EGCs) in intestinal homeostasis, immunity and tissue repair. We demonstrate that infection of mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus (H. poly) leads to enteric gliosis and upregulation of the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) gene signature. Single-cell transcriptomics of tunica muscularis (TM) showed that glia-specific abrogation of IFN-γ signaling leads to tissue-wide activation of pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs. In addition, disruption of the IFN-γ-EGC signaling axis enhanced the inflammatory and granulomatous response of TM to helminths. Mechanistically, we show that upregulation of Cxcl10 is an early immediate response of EGCs to IFN-γ signaling and provide evidence that this chemokine and the downstream amplification of IFN-γ signaling in the TM are required for a measured inflammatory response to helminths and resolution of granulomatous pathology. Our study demonstrates that IFN-γ signaling in enteric glia is central to intestinal homeostasis and reveals critical roles of the IFN-γ-EGC-Cxcl10 axis in immune response and tissue repair following infectious challenge. To characterize the response of enteric glia to helminth infection at single cell resolution, we next performed scRNAseq (C1 Fluidigm platform) of tdT+ cells from the TM of naïve and H. poly-infected mice.

Although dysregulation of skeletal muscle metabolism can strongly influence the homeostasis of systemic energy, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We found promoter hypermethylation and decreased gene expression of fibroblast growth factor 6 (FGF6) in the skeletal muscle of individuals with obesity using high-throughput sequencing. Reduced binding of the cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein-1 (CREB1) to the hypermethylated cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element, which is a regulatory element upstream of the transcription initiation site, partially contributed to the downregulation of FGF6 in patients with obesity. Overexpression of Fgf6 in mice skeletal muscle stimulated protein synthesis, activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and prevented the increase in weight and the development of insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed mice. Thus, our findings highlight the role played by Fgf6 in regulating skeletal muscle hypertrophy and whole-body metabolism, indicating its potential in strategies aimed at preventing and treating metabolic diseases.

Here we interrogated the effect of CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with mTOR inhibtor. Also, we interrogtaed the efffect of AURK and WEE1 inhibition in ER+ breast cacner models While the RB-pathway has been purported to exhibit multiple mutually exclusive events, only RB1 is mutually exclusive with multiple genetic events that deregulate CDK4/6 activity. Using an isogenic ER+ breast cancer model with targeted RB1 deletion, we identified gene expression features that link CDK4/6 activity and RB-dependency (CDK4/6-RB integrated signature). We also investigated the role of RB on apoptotic pathway. Single copy loss on chromosome 13q encompassing the RB1 locus is prevalent in many cancers, and is associated with reduced expression of multiple genes on 13q including RB1, and inversely related to the CDK4/6-RB integrated signature supporting a genetic cause/effect relationship. To probe the broader implications on tumor biology, we investigated genes that are positively and inversely correlated with the CDK4/6-RB integrated signature. This approach defined tumor-specific pathways that could represent new therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with RB-pathway activity.

In this study, ISG upregulation by WNV infection was inhibited in RIG-I/MDA5-/- but not in single knockout MEFs. ISGs upregulation was detected in WNV-infected IRF1-/- and IRF5-/- but was minimal in IRF3/5/7-/- MEFs, suggesting redundant IRF involvement. ISG upregulation by WNV infection in IFNAR-/- MEFs was confirmed by RNA-seq. We previously showed that a single proximal interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) in the Oas1a and Oas1b promoters bound the ISGF3 complex during IFN-dependent upregulation. In this study, we used wild-type and mutant promoter luciferase reporter constructs to identify critical regions in the Oas1b and Ifit1 promoters for IFN-independent transcriptional regulation. Two ISREs were required for both promoters. Mutation of these ISREs in an Ifit1 promoter DNA probe reduced in vitro complex formation. An NF-κB inhibitor decreased Ifit1 promoter activity in cells and in vitro complex formation. IRF3 and p50 binding was detected by ChIP for four upregulated ISGs with two proximal ISREs in their promoters. The data indicate that IFN-independent ISG expression of some ISGs is upregulated by two ISREs functioning cooperatively and the binding of a complex consisting of IRF3, 5, and/or 7 and an NF-κB component(s) as well as other as yet unknown factors.		uninfected;Mouse embryonic fibroblasts IFNAR-/-;WNV infected;Mouse embryonic fibroblasts;24 h;C57BL/6;12 h

However, almost half of the patients with graft loss have a 1-year biopsy that is either normal or has only interstitial fibrosis. The goal of this study was to determine if there was a gene expression profile in these relatively normal 1-year biopsies that predicted subsequent decline in renal function. Using transcriptome microarrays we measured intragraft mRNA levels in a retrospective Discovery cohort (170 patients with a normal/minimal fibrosis 1-year biopsy, 54 with progressive decline in function/graft loss and 116 with stable function) and developed a nested 10-fold cross-validated gene classifier that predicted progressive decline in renal function (positive predictive value=38±34%%; negative predictive value=73±30%, c-statistic=0.59). In a prospective, multicenter Validation cohort (270 patients with Normal/Interstitial Fibrosis [IF]), the classifier had a 20% positive predictive value, 85% negative predictive value and 0.58 c-statistic. Importantly, the majority of patients with graft loss in the prospective study had 1-year biopsies scored as Normal or IF. We conclude predicting graft loss in many renal allograft recipients (i.e. those with a relatively normal 1-year biopsy and eGFR >40) remains difficult.

In this study, we constituted a single-cell atlas for 26,737 high-quality cells from hyperplastic periapical tissue using single-cell RNA sequencing.

The temporal profiling of genomic alterations from common CAP to typical periapical granuloma provided predictions for key transcription factors and biological processes.

Here, we perform a transcriptomic analysis of various in vitro hiPSC-CM platforms (2D iPSC-CM, 3D iPSC-CM and hCOs) to deduce strengths and limitations of these in vitro models. We further compared iPSC-CM models to human myocardium samples. Our data shows that the 3D in vitro environment of 3D hiPSC-CMs and hCOs stimulates expression of genes associated with tissue formation. hCOs demonstrated diverse physiologically relevant cellular functions compared to hiPSC-CM only models. Including other cardiac cell types within hCOs led to more transcriptomic similarly to adult myocardium. hCOs lack matured cardiomyocytes and immune cells which limits a complete replication of human adult myocardium. In conclusion, 3D hCOs are transcriptomically similar to myocardium, and future developments of engineered 3D cardiac models would benefit from diversifying cell populations, especially immune cells.

In particular, the expansions of the CGG-repeats stretch at the 5'-UTR of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene have pleiotropic effects that lead to a variety of Fragile X-associated syndromes: the neurodevelopmental Fragile X syndrome (FXS) in children, the late-onset neurodegenerative disorder Fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) that mainly affects adult men, the Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) in adult women, and a variety of psychiatric and affective disorders that are under the term of Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND). There have been intensive attempts to identify reliable peripheral biomarkers to assess disease progression and onset of specific pathological traits. We profiled the miRNAs content of plasma from premutation carriers and controls.

GSE180981	2021.08.31	Homo sapiens	GPL18573	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Transcriptional Control of Brain Tumour Stem Cells by a Carbohydrate Binding Protein	Brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs) and intratumoural heterogeneity represent major challenges in glioblastoma therapy. Here, we report that the LGALS1 gene, encoding the carbohydrate binding protein, galectin1, is a key regulator of BTSCs and glioblastoma resistance to therapy. Genetic deletion of LGALS1 alters BTSC gene expression profiles and results in downregulation of gene sets associated with mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we establish that inhibition of LGALS1 signalling in BTSCs impairs self-renewal, suppresses tumourigenesis, prolongs lifespan, and improves glioblastoma response to ionizing radiation in preclinical animal models. Mechanistically, we show that LGALS1 is a direct transcriptional target of STAT3 with its expression robustly regulated by the ligand OSM. Importantly, we establish that galectin1 forms a complex with the transcription factor HOXA5 to reprogram BTSC transcriptional landscape. Our data unravel an oncogenic signalling pathway by which galectin1/HOXA5 complex maintains BTSCs and promotes glioblastoma.

Poor patient survival, due to inadequate response to currently available treatment regimens, points out to the urgent requirement for personalized therapy in CRC patients. Our aim was to provide mechanistic insights into the pro-tumorigenic role of the RNA-binding protein ESRP1, which is highly expressed in a subset of CRC patients. We show that, in CRC cells, ESRP1 binds to and has the same trend in expression as RAC1b, a well-known tumor promoter. Thus, RAC1b may be a potential therapeutic target in ESRP1-overexpressing CRC. RNA binding proteins are well recognized as critical regulators of tumorigenic processes through their capacity to modulate RNA biogenesis, including alternative splicing, RNA stability and mRNA translation. The RNA binding protein Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Protein 1 (ESRP1) can act as tumor suppressor or promoter in a cell type- and disease context-dependent manner. We have previously shown that elevated expression of ESRP1 in colorectal cancer cells can drive tumor progression. To gain further insights into the pro-tumorigenic mechanism of action of ESRP1, we performed cDNA microarray analysis on two colorectal cells lines modulated for ESRP1 expression. Intriguingly, RAC1b was highly expressed, both at mRNA and protein levels, in ESRP1-overexpressing cells, while the opposite trend was observed in ESRP1-silenced CRC cells. Moreover, RAC1 and RAC1b mRNA co-immunoprecipitate with ESRP1 protein. Silencing of RAC1b expression significantly reduced the number of soft agar colonies formed by ESRP1-overexpressing cells, suggesting that ESRP1 acted, at least partially, through RAC1b in its tumor-promoting activities in CRC cells. Thus, our data provide molecular cues on targetable candidates in CRC cases with high ESRP1 expression.		Empty;COLO320DM Empty 10X;ESRP1;CRC cell line;COLO320DM ESRP1 10X

Method : PDLF were transfected wtih either control siRNA or siRNA for PPARg and then cultured in mineralization inducing medium for 6 days. Total RNAs were collected before and after the culture. Result : Gene ontology analyses of RNA-seq data revealed the genes functionally related with ECM such as collagen synthesis and trimerization, proteoglycans, and fibers were selectively increased by 6-day culture and suppressed biological processes by si-PPARg compared with si-control at day 6 exhibited 5 of 7 upper ranked biological processes were related with ECM organization and metabolism. Moreover, the upper rank of suppressed pathways by si-PPARg compared with si-control at day 6 showed `Endochondral Ossification` was ranked 1st. Conclusions:These results suggested that knockdown of PPARg was sufficient to eliminate osteo/cementogenic and ECM organizing potentials by comprehensive transcriptional dysregulation in PDLF.

Methods: A total of 6 samples were tested using the DNBSEQ platform, 3 samples with viral mediated expression of GFP in mDRGs, the other 3 samples with viral mediated expression of the light chain protease of botulinum toxin A (LCA) in mDRGs, with an average yield of 1.12 G data per sample. The average alignment ratio of the sample comparison genome was 96.00%, which was comparative. The average alignment of the gene set was 83.78%; a total of 19963 genes were detected. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, RNA-seq data confirmed cleavage of SNAP-25 affects the mRNA levels of certain neuropeptide genes, receptors and transducers. Altered expression of 5 genes were validated using RT–qPCR. RNA-seq data were consistent with RT-qPCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Conclusions: Our study show that viral mediated cleavage of SNAP-25 robustly downregulated mRNA levels of certain neuropeptide genes, receptors and transducers.

Cardiac fibrosis is associated with both pathological conditions. Our previous work identified a link between phytosterol accumulation, cardiac fibrosis and death in a mouse model of phytosterolemia, a rare disorder characterized by elevated circulating phytosterols and increased cardiovascular disease risk. Here, we uncover a previously unknown pathological link between phytosterols and cardiac arrhythmias in the same animal model. Phytosterolemia resulted in inflammatory pathway induction, premature ventricular contractions (PVC) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of phytosterol absorption prevented the induction of both pathways. Inhibition of phytosterol absorption reduced inflammation and cardiac fibrosis, improved cardiac function, reduced the incidence of arrhythmias and increased survival in a mouse model of phytosterolemia. Collectively, this work identified a pathological mechanism whereby elevated phytosterols result in inflammation and cardiac fibrosis leading to impaired cardiac function, arrhythmias and sudden death. These phytosterolemia-associated comorbidities provide novel insight into the underlying pathophysiological mechanism that predispose these patients to increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

Using this system, we analyzed population shifts and lineage-specific enrichment for 51 cancer associated genes and gene variants, profiling over 100,000 cells spanning over 20 lineages, across two rounds of serially injected teratomas.

The absence of single-cell investigations into the broader population of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) renders it difficult to distinguish immune features unique to COVID-19 from the common characteristics of a dysregulated host response to pneumonia. We performed integrated single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in PBMCs from a strictly matched cohort of eight patients with COVID-19, eight patients with CAP, and four non-infectious control subjects. With this balanced, multi-omic approach we describe diverging transcriptional and phenotypic patterns in T cell, NK cell and monocyte populations between patients with CAP caused by either SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A or other pathogens, and thereby expand our understanding of the peripheral immune response in different forms of CAP.

However, many patient-matched features of the transcriptome involved in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence remain unidentified. The aim of this study was to identify genes associated with the process of CRC formation by analyzing the characteristics of the transcriptome during tumor formation. Six dynamic expression patterns specific to tumor formation were characterized for the first time. Dysregulation of metabolic pathways, suppression of the immune system, and activation of canonical pathways related to cancer were associated with the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.

Since PPARγ has a high level of basal activity, we hypothesized that epidermal PPARγ would regulate normal homeostatic processes within the epidermis. In this current study, we performed mRNA sequencing and differential expression analysis of epidermal scrapings from knockout mice and wildtype littermates. Pparg-/-epi mice exhibited a 1.5-fold or greater change in the expression of 11.8% of 14,482 identified transcripts. Up-regulated transcripts included those for a large number of cytokines/chemokines and their receptors, as well as genes associated with inflammasome activation and keratinization. Several of the most dramatically up-regulated pro-inflammatory genes in Pparg-/-epi mouse skin included Igfl3, 2610528A11Rik, & Il1f6. RT-PCR was performed from RNA obtained from non-lesional full-thickness skin and verified a marked increase in these transcripts, as well as transcripts for Igflr1, which encodes the receptor for Igfl3, and the 2610528A11Rik receptor (Gpr15). Transcripts for Il4 were detected in Pparg-/-epi mouse skin, but transcripts for Il17 & Il22 were not detected. Down-regulated transcripts included sebaceous gland markers and a number of genes associated with lipid barrier formation. The change in these transcripts correlates with an asebia phenotype, increased transepidermal water loss, alopecia, dandruff and the appearance of spontaneous inflammatory skin lesions. Histologically, non-lesional skin showed hyperkeratosis, while inflammatory lesions were characterized by dermal inflammation and epidermal acanthosis, spongiosis, and parakeratosis. In conclusion, loss of epidermal Pparg alters a substantial set of genes that are associated with cutaneous inflammation, keratinization and sebaceous gland function. This data indicates that epidermal PPARγ plays an important role in homeostatic epidermal function, particularly epidermal differentiation, barrier function, sebaceous gland development and function, and inflammatory signaling.

Although each MDEM has a different causative gene, they exhibit several overlapping disease manifestations. Here, we hypothesize that this phenotypic convergence is a consequence of common abnormalities at the epigenomic level, which directly or indirectly lead to downstream convergence at the transcriptomic level. This implies that identifying abnormalities shared across multiple MDEMs could pinpoint locations where epigenetic variation is causally related to disease phenotypes. To test our hypothesis, we perform a comprehensive interrogation of chromatin (ATAC-Seq) and expression (RNA-Seq) states in B cells from mouse models of three MDEMs (Kabuki types 1&2 and Rubinstein-Taybi syndromes). We build on recent work in covariate-powered multiple testing to develop a new approach for the overlap analysis, which enables us to find extensive overlap primarily localized in gene promoters. We show that disruption of chromatin accessibility at promoters often leads to disruption of downstream gene expression, and identify a total of 463 loci and 249 genes commonly disrupted across the three MDEMs. As an example of how widespread dysregulation leads to specific phenotypes, we show that subtle expression alterations of multiple, directly relevant genes, collectively contribute to IgA deficiency in KS1 and RT. In contrast, we predict that KS2 does not have IgA deficiency, and confirm this pattern in mice. We propose that the joint study of MDEMs offers a principled approach for systematically mapping functional epigenetic variation in mammals.		85 days;72 days;C57BL/6j;Kabuki syndrome type 1;CD19+ B cells;Kabuki syndrome type 2;84 days;CD19+ B cells from peripheral blood;Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome type 1;Wild-type (Rubinstein-Taybi cohort);98 days;82 days;Wild-type (Kabuki cohorts);74 days

Here we examined embryonic stem (ES) cell fate in the absence of de novo DNA methyltransferases. We observed that ES cells deficient for both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are rapidly eliminated from chimeras. On further investigation we found that in vivo and in vitro the formative pluripotency transition is derailed toward production of trophoblast. This aberrant trajectory is associated with failure to suppress activation of Ascl2. Ascl2 encodes a bHLH transcription factor expressed in the placenta. Misexpression of Ascl2 in ES cells provokes transdifferentiation to trophoblast-like cells. Conversely, Ascl2 deletion rescues formative transition of Dnmt3a/b mutants and improves contribution to chimeric epiblast. Thus, de novo DNA methylation safeguards against ectopic activation of Ascl2. However, Dnmt3a/b-deficient cells remain defective in ongoing embryogenesis. We surmise that multiple developmental transitions may be secured by DNA methylation silencing potentially disruptive genes. This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

GSE158296	2021.08.31	Homo sapiens	GPL21697	TRUE	FALSE	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			An NSD3-targeting PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeric) suppresses the NSD3 and cMyc oncogenic nodes in cancer cells	Nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 3 (NSD3), a gene located within the 8p11-p12 amplicon frequently detected in human cancers, encodes a chromatin modulator and an attractive onco-target. However, agent that can effectively suppress the NSD3-mediated oncogenic actions is currently lacking. Here, we report an NSD3-targeting proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), termed MS9715, which achieves effective and specific depletion of NSD3 and interacting partners (including cMyc) in tumor cells. We show that MS9715-induced NSD3 degradation relies on BI-9321, an antagonist module binding the PWWP1 domain of NSD3, and VHL, which is chemically conjugated to BI-9321 via a linker and a VHL ligand. Importantly, compared to BI-9321, a recently disclosed NSD3 antagonist, MS9715 is more potent in suppressing growth of the NSD3-dependent hematological cancer including models of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and multiple myeloma (MM), and uniquely mediates simultaneous depletion of cellular NSD3 and cMyc. Transcriptome profiling further demonstrates effective actions of MS9715 but not BI-9321 in suppressing both the NSD3- and cMyc-mediated gene-expression programs, a phenomenon reminiscent of the CRISPR/cas9-mediated knockout (KO) of NSD3. Together, this study reports a first-in-class NSD3 degrader suitable for co-suppressing NSD3- and cMyc-related oncogenic nodes in cancer, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy,		sgEV;BI_9321;EOL-1 cells;DMSO;sgNSD3;MS9715;MS9715N

The OTX2 homeoprotein is critical for choroid plexus development and remains highly expressed in adult choroid plexus. Through RNA sequencing analyses of constitutive and conditional knockdown adult mouse models, we reveal putative roles for OTX2 in choroid plexus function, including cell signaling and adhesion, and show that it regulates the expression of factors secreted into cerebrospinal fluid, notably transthyretin. We also show that Otx2 expression impacts choroid plexus immune and stress responses, and also affects splicing which leads to changes in mRNA isoforms of proteins implicated in oxidative stress response and DNA repair. Through mass spectrometry analysis of OTX2 protein partners in the choroid plexus, and in known non-cell autonomous target regions such as visual cortex and subventricular zone, we identified putative targets involved in cell adhesion, chromatin structure and RNA processing. Thus, OTX2 retains important roles in choroid plexus function and brain homeostasis throughout life.

Anp32e was recently identified an H2A.Z-specific histone chaperone that removes H2A.Z from nucleosomes in dividing cells, but whether it plays a similar role in non-dividing neurons is unknown. Moreover, prior studies only investigated effects of Anp32e on H2A.Z binding under steady state-conditions, such that its effect on H2A.Z removal under stimulus-induced conditions is unknown. Here, we show that Anp32e regulates H2A.Z binding in neurons under steady-state conditions, but that stimulus-induced H2A.Z removal is largely independent of Anp32e. In assessing the functional consequences of Anp32e, we showed that its depletion leads to H2A.Z-dependent impairment in dendritic arborization in cultured hippocampal neurons, as well as impaired recall of contextual fear memory and transcriptional regulation. Together, these data indicate the Anp32E regulates behavioral and morphological outcomes by preventing H2A.Z accumulation in chromatin rather than by regulating activity-mediated H2A.Z dynamics.		shAnp32e;Vehicle/untreated;primary cells;primary hippocampal neurons;9 DIV;30'after KCl;shScr;mouse hippocampal neurons;shAnp32e+shH2afz

We used one-day-old mice with cardiac-specific knockout of β-catenin and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes treated with β-catenin inhibitor to investigate the role of β-catenin metabolism regulation in perinatal cardiomyocytes. Transcriptomics of perinatal β-catenin-ablated hearts revealed a dramatic shift in the expression of genes involved in metabolic processes. Further analysis indicated an inhibition of lipolysis and glycolysis in both in vitro and in vivo models. Finally, we showed that β-catenin deficiency leads to mitochondria dysfunction via the downregulation of Sirt1/PGC-1α pathway. We conclude that cardiac-specific β-catenin ablation disrupts the energy substrate shift that is essential for postnatal heart maturation, leading to perinatal lethality of homozygous β-catenin knockout mice.

Here, we show that the natural compound, atraric acid (AA), inhibits besides the androgen receptor (AR) those AR-mutants that confer therapy resistance to AR-antagonists indicating a different mode of AR-antagonism. AA induces cellular senescence and inhibits intratumoral angiogenesis and CRPC tumour growth in treated xenograft mice. RNA-seq reveals an upregulated angiogenic transcriptional pathway by androgen. In line with this, conditioned medium from CRPC cells induces angiogenesis in two in vitro models using primary human endothelial cells. By employing immune arrays and mass-spec analyses, we found that androgens induced secretion of pro-angiogenic factors pinpointing to angiopoeitin2 (ANGPT2). The senescence-associated secretory phenotype revealed reduced ANGPT2 secretion by AA. Accordingly, immune-depletion of ANGPT2 or blocking ANGPT2-receptors inhibits angiogenesis.

The NF-κB1—/— bone marrow derived macrophages showed increased level of cytokines which further exacerbated with H. pylori infection. To map the contribution of macrophages in the spontaneous gastritis, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of NF-κB1—/— mice gastric macrophage and H. pylori treated macrophages. The transcriptome analysis showed an upregulation of innate immune response genes in NF-κB1—/— gastric macrophages, but not in H. pylori activated murine macrophages. Network analysis identified STAT1/TLR7/TLR13 as a key regulator and inhibition of STAT1 activation attenuated exacerbated innate immune response. NF-κB1—/— mice after infection with H. pylori showed increased histological gastritis and reduced level of H. pylori colonization. Our study indicates that H. pylori-mediated up-regulation of NF-κB1 mitigates host immune response and promotes chronic colonization of the pathogen.

Tilting hematopoiesis towards innate immunity has been linked to inflammation and may predispose to myeloproliferative disease. Although epigenetic players have been implicated in the control of hematopoiesis and pathogenesis of blood neoplasms, the role of chromatin-based mechanisms in regulating the lymphoid/myeloid balance remains only partially understood. Here, we show that loss of the H3.3 chaperone Daxx causes myeloid skewing, neutrophilia and pyoderma gangrenosum-like lesions, a human skin disease of unknown etiology. Daxx deficiency leads to chromatin opening at intergenic regions, including TERRA target sites, deregulation of repeat elements and activation of anti-viral defense pathways. Finally, the other main H3.3 chaperone, Hira, is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis but supports expansion of Daxx-deficient neutrophils. These results define a role for Daxx in proper selection of lymphoid versus myeloid lineages, linked to control of repeat elements and anti-inflammatory responses.

Proper regulation of aNPC fate entails important implications for brain plasticity and healthy aging. Piwi proteins and the small noncoding RNAs interacting with them (piRNAs) are best known in gonads as repressors of transposons. Here, we show that Piwil2 (Mili) and piRNAs are abundant in aNPCs of the postnatal mouse hippocampus and demonstrate that this pathway is essential for proper neurogenesis. Particularly, depleting the piRNA pathway in aNPCs impaired neurogenesis while increasing senescence and the generation of reactive glia. Moreover, depletion of the piRNA pathway primarily elevated 5S ribosomal RNA, SINEB1 and mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and regulators of translation, resulting in higher polysome density and protein synthesis upon differentiation. Our results provide evidence of an essential role for the piRNA pathway in maintaining homeostasis to sustain neural stem cell fate, underpinning its possible involvement in brain plasticity and successful aging.

GSE178901	2021.08.30	Homo sapiens	GPL21290	TRUE	FALSE	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			STING-driven interferon signaling triggers metabolic alterations in pancreas cancer cells visualized by [18F]FLT PET imaging	Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical effectors of emerging cancer immunotherapies designed to activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). A challenge in the clinical translation of these new immuno-modulatory agents is the lack of pharmacodynamic biomarkers indicative of increased intratumoral IFN signaling following PRR activation. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging enables the visualization of tissue metabolic activity but whether IFN signaling-induced alterations in tumor cell metabolism can be detected using PET has not been investigated. We found that IFN signaling augments pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell nucleotide metabolism via transcriptional induction of metabolism-associated genes including thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP). TYMP catalyzes the first step in the catabolism of thymidine which competitively inhibits intratumoral accumulation of the nucleoside analog PET probe [18F]-fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT). Accordingly, IFN treatment stimulates cancer cell [18F]FLT uptake in the presence of thymidine and this effect is dependent on TYMP expression. In vivo, genetic activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a PRR widely expressed in PDAC, enhances the [18F]FLT avidity of xenograft tumors. Treatment with a small molecule STING agonist triggers IFN signaling-dependent TYMP expression in PDAC cells and enhances both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor [18F]FLT uptake in vivo following systemic treatment. These findings indicate that [18F]FLT accumulation in tumors is sensitive to IFN signaling and that [18F]FLT PET may serve as a novel pharmacodynamic biomarker for PRR agonist-based immunotherapies in PDAC and possibly other malignancies characterized by elevated STING expression.		100 U/mL human IFNβ for 24 hours;pancreas cancer cells;control treated;100 U/mL human IFNβ for 6 hours;SUIT2

Cells with MSI accumulate numerous frameshift mutations. Frameshift mutations affecting cancer-related genes may promote tumorigenesis and, therefore, are shared among independently arising MSI tumors. Consequently, such recurrent frameshift mutations can give rise to shared immunogenic frameshift peptides (FSPs) that represent ideal candidates for a vaccine against MSI cancer. Pathogenic germline variants of mismatch repair genes cause Lynch syndrome (LS), a hereditary cancer syndrome affecting approximately 20-25 million individuals worldwide. LS individuals are at high risk of developing MSI cancer. Previously, we demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of an FSP-based vaccine in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial. However, the cancer-preventive effect of FSP vaccination in the scenario of LS has not been demonstrated so far.		normal;A;Aspirin;Naproxen + FSP vaccine;RV;NV;Regular Chow;Western Diet;Aspirin + FSP vaccine;N;RC;R;Intestinal Tissue;AV;Naproxen;Tumor;FSP vaccine

The cell fate decisions between plasmablasts (PBs), germinal center B cells (GCBCs) and non-GC-derived early memory B cells (eMBCs) during early B cell activation determine the outcome of the immune responses to pathogens and vaccines. To characterize these poorly understood lineage choices, we dissected the early B cell responses to T-dependent antigen in mice by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Early after immunization, a homogenous population of activated precursors (APs) gave rise to a transient wave of PBs, followed a day later by the emergence of the first GCBCs, with the transcriptomes of both rapidly diverging from that of APs. The majority of APs started to withdraw from the cell cycle very early on and gave rise to eMBCs, a developmental transition that involved limited transcriptional changes. These events were controlled by antigen availability that rapidly declined soon after immunization, and provision of antigen excess interfered with the cell cycle exit of APs and induced a new wave of PBs. Fate mapping experiments revealed a prominent contribution of eMBCs to the overall MBC pool. Generation of the earliest GCBCs was tightly controlled by the transcriptional repressor Bhlhe40 in the absence of which this population was increased in numbers. Bhlhe40 also restrained in a cell intrinsic fashion the response of T follicular helper (TFH) cells, a specialized T helper cell subset required to mount the GC response. In B cells, Bhlhe40 executed its function in the first days after immunization by selectively restricting the generation of the earliest GCBCs but not of eMBCs or PBs. Conditional Bhlhe40 inactivation confirmed cell-autonomous functions of Bhlhe40 in both GCBCs and TFH cells, while the GC phenotype was further enhanced upon loss of Bhlhe40 in both cell types. This negative regulation of the GC reaction by Bhlhe40 was of crucial importance, as Bhlhe40-deficient mice with progressing age succumbed to a B cell lymphoma characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal GCBCs-like cells and polyclonal TFH cells in various tissues.

To address mechanisms of durable and aborted control of viremia, we evaluated immunologic and virologic parameters in longitudinal samples from 34 subjects with differential outcomes. Despite sustained recognition of autologous virus, aborted control was preceded by impairment of HIV-specific proliferative and cytolytic T cell effector functions without evidence of canonical T cell exhaustion. During aborted control, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells infiltrated lymphoid follicles but exhibited poor functionality relative to durable control. Longitudinal transcriptomic profiling of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells revealed altered expression of genes related to T cell activation, cytokine-mediated signaling and cell cycle regulation preceding aborted control, including increased expression of the antiproliferative transcription factor KLF2. Our results identify prognostic indicators of aborted HIV control and elucidate functional requirements for durable immune control, which may guide development of new therapies		8.16713838522097;0.295462639915602;0.328763329277462;0.632272521262623;5.64992390011625;0.595897061103178;11.7108633769096;Sorted tetramer positive CD8+ lymphocytes;0.611898984160659;7.2111388933973;0.6343602390326;0.609662633379749;7.60379352052546;0.584049070611171;8.4617645072311;0.198409986687925;20.6967477090801;AC;L376_3;L376_4;0.618904634749625;0.599750441272632;0.418088505072555;7.1969216403954;5.77048880484638;0.650746911829405;0.433069660862429;0.590219737365149;15.9353078634116;0.198291194105588;0.408626109795096;5.47049147957187;0.337643329033322;0.603170473189191;10.4753919824967;0.287646507140162;7.24817277214853;F;9.85445655034368;0.565771200149033;0.191579691531038;0.622554971529199;0.594110374163355;0.566255584693483;M;0.61137691458469;0.580334326608305;15.946418299806;0.460677017450333;0.450881588819193;0.409581323126403;0.586144467712695;13.3021755982868;0.594591027827961;T1;T2;T3;12.6670897290721;8.21478976165578;5.60381964310011;6.25720605016846;8.06211542030243;7.51500134976137;0.591717440682451;10.3858085407982;11.1687270079008;21.2616534643244;7.10390737802248;0.611999930957564;0.633282256147897;7.3037888603805;0.553862937449519;0.543501156417812;7.5785504243215;0.384335700655634;10.7110314256752;9.46859708999271;DC;13.8658146267807;0.641638160826951;6.77933661940628;6.07604362267331;9.44970377310136;0.416010023449148;0.456016619678358;0.569725100670185;9.84958615316554;0.570567449010762;10.0966233483092;0.55649945150958;11.2213491051537;0.266795929086295;0.593423462647367;0.245248679923095;0.653361126965845;6.59037424136635;7.09137569945484;9.8688885916318;0.576408755564126;11.0550531401539;10.5036094516813;0.409249772658887;7.65405234128345;8.08207302495692;A110X;0.647417597285243;5.78672565823299;7.53228163855017;10.9146009116285;5.55160928370787;13.4254681351883;0.492921180714438;16.1279757430256;0.561235115792772;AC04;AC05;5.84656468998363;0.325999821292958;7.15722953266313;10.1430233136095;0.61333461995053;0.484776733701776;19.0621110239046;5.33183590722604;15.4864203236051;5.8016988846817;0.372970201762144;6.27150368755387;0.253848819572194;0.552728240775507;0.548066671927995;4.63086561163983;0.473368578179193;0.305422564034228;5.58169297487743;0.551560663701409;0.613236655598502;6.22203487282353;8.34943228628772;AC17;0.512301517866438;8.04452933625575;0.352273923707045;DC05;AC14;DC04;0.484489772934833;DC03;11.910640913864;21.4109153433143;10.7866736051087;DC01;AC10;0.456850911675171;6.42110669540494;6.16653065080511;6.69040183593361;0.583923037074247;6.36999107678267;0.4974970026348;11.1744873310473;7.75907770012662;4.80293948840836;13.9372617047621;0.353779743574283;0.489034058742805;DC15;0.199961097098402;0.565740308455346

Dichotomous tumour-promoting and -restrictive roles have been ascribed to the tumour microenvironment, however the effects of individual stromal subsets remains incompletely characterised. Here, we describe how heterocellular OSM-OSMR signalling instructs fibroblast reprogramming, tumour growth and metastasis. Macrophage-secreted OSM stimulates inflammatory gene expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which in turn induce a pro-tumorigenic environment and engage tumour cell survival and migratory signalling pathways. Tumour cells implanted in Osm-deficient (Osm-/-) mice display an epithelial-dominated morphology, reduced tumour growth and did not metastasise. Moreover, the tumour microenvironment of Osm-/- animals exhibit increased abundance of αSMApos myofibroblasts and a shift in myeloid and T cell phenotypes, consistent with a more immunogenic environment. Taken together, these data demonstrate how OSM-OSMR signalling coordinates heterocellular interactions to drive a pro-tumorigenic environment in PDA.

In stem cell compartments, the shorter NF-YA splice variant (NF-YAs) is abundantly expressed and sustains their expansion. Here, we report that satellite cells, the stem cell population of adult skeletal muscle necessary for its growth and regeneration, express uniquely the longer NF-YA isoform (NF-YAl), majorly associated with cell differentiation. Through the generation of a conditional knock out mouse model that selectively ablates NF-YA in satellite cells, we demonstrate that NF-YA expression, and hence NF-Y activity, is fundamental to preserve the pool of muscle stem cells. Moreover, NF-Y supports their commitment to differentiation and ensures robust regenerative response to muscle injury. Gene expression profiling highlights an unexpected role for NF-Y in stem cell biology and opens a new scenario for NF-Y activity that is dispensable for muscle stem cell proliferation but required for efficient myogenic differentiation.

The goal of this study is to identify the earliest gene expression patterns in lower motor neurons that drive selective neuronal vulnerability in a mouse model of ALS. We have implemented transgenic SOD1G93A with a lower motor neuron fluorescent reporter (HB9-GFP) mice to unambiguously isolate spinal motor neurons using FACS for gene expression profiling using RNA sequencing at embryonic day (E)12.5. Data from this transcriptomic study allowed the identification of disturbance in MN homeostasis which occur at the day of birth of spinal motor neurons in SOD1G93A mice. Pathway analysis uncovered several remarkably dysregulated pathways including RNA metabolism disturbance and excitotoxicity. Our findings have the potential to reveal insights into the incipient molecular mechanisms that confer motor neuron vulnerability and therefore may highlight relevant gene targets and pathways for effective intervention in ALS.

This is particularly true for patients suffering from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) who exhibit a wide range of cognitive deficiencies including impaired motor skill development. While these effects have been well characterized, the molecular effects that bring about these behavioral consequences remain to be determined. We have previously found that the acute molecular responses to alcohol in the embryonic brain are stochastic, varying among neural progenitor cells. However, the pathophysiological consequences stemming from these heterogeneous responses remain unknown. Here we show that acute responses to alcohol in progenitor cells lead to altered gene expression in their descendant neurons at the single-cell level. Among the altered genes, we found that an increase of the calcium-activated potassium channel Kcnn2 in subset neurons in the motor cortex correlates with motor skill learning deficits in the mouse model of FASD. We further show that postnatal blocking of Kcnn2 improves these learning deficits. These results propose Kcnn2 blockers as a novel intervention for learning disabilities in FASD and possibly for other neurocognitive conditions.

GSE131348	2021.08.30	Mus musculus	GPL13112	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE		34548527	The effects of metformin on the early LPS response of macrophages	Metformin is a front-line drug in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to its antigluconeogenic and insulin-sensitizing properties, it has emerged as a potent inhibitor of the inflammatory response of macrophages. Specifically, metformin has been shown to reduce transcript levels of Il1b, the gene encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1b, during long-term exposure of macrophages to the bacterial cell-wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, the extent to which metformin affects the early transcriptional response to LPS has never been investigated. Here, we show that metformin affects transcript levels of a large yet selective subset of LPS-responsive genes after only two hours of LPS exposure, mostly counteracting the effect of LPS rather than enhancing it. The affected genes are implicated in a variety of biological functions, in particular cellular movement and trafficking. Intriguingly, metformin affects transcript levels of Il1b at this early time point as well, but through a molecular mechanism fundamentally different from the regulation observed after longer exposure. While down-regulation of Il1b by metformin during the late stages of the LPS response has been shown to rely on stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and production of IL-10, Il1b inhibition at the early stage requires AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation but is independent of HIF-1α and IL-10. These results reveal an unexpected complexity in the anti-inflammatory properties of metformin and demonstrate that Il1b is down-regulated by distinct mechanisms in the early and late stages of the LPS response.		untreated;Bone-marrow-derived macrophages;100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 2 h;5 mM metformin for 6 h -> 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2 h;C57BL/6

Purpose: The importin (IPO) superfamily member IPO13 is able to mediate nuclear transport bidirectionally. To better understand IPO13 involvement in cellular signalling, we performed transcriptomic analysis on wild-type and IPO13-knockout mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), with gene ontology (GO) annotation results indicating enrichment of differentially expressed genes involved in stress responses and regulation of apoptosis. To examine IPO13's contribtion to the response to cellular stress, we employed RNA sequencing to investigate and compare the transcription profile of wild-type and IPO13-knockout ESCs in the presence and absence of oxidative stress. Methods: Wild-type and IPO13-knock out mESCs were treated with or without 125 µM H2O2 for 1 h, after which the medium was replaced and cells recovered in the absence of H2O2 for 2 h. Total RNA was isolated and used to generate sequencing libraries using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit. Sequencing was then performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. qRT-PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: Results comparing Wild-type and IPO13-knock out cell lines indicated that IPO13 knock out results in the down-regulation of 338 genes and up-regulation of 536 genes. This included genes involved in stress response and apoptotic pathways. Comparison of specific gene subset differentially expressed in response to H2O2 treatment identifiedd 277 IPO13-dependent genes up- or down-regulated exclusively in the Wild-type cell line and not in the IPO13-knock out cell line, highlighting the importance of IPO13 in the transcriptional response to oxidative stress. Conclusion: IPO13 plays a key role in the stress response.

GSE182827	2021.08.29	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Bub1 and CENP-U redundantly recruit Plk1 to stabilize kinetochore-microtubule attachments and ensure accurate chromosome segregation	Bub1 is required for the kinetochore/centromere localization of two essential mitotic kinases Plk1 and Aurora B. Surprisingly, stable depletion of Bub1 by ~95% in human cells marginally affects whole chromosome segregation fidelity. We show that CENP-U, which is recruited to kinetochores by the CENP-P and CENP-Q subunits of the CENP-O complex, is required to prevent chromosome mis-segregation in Bub1-depleted cells. Mechanistically, Bub1 and CENP-U redundantly recruit Plk1 to kinetochores to stabilize kinetochore-microtubule attachments, thereby ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Furthermore, unlike its budding yeast homolog, the CENP-O complex does not regulate centromeric localization of Aurora B. Consistently, depletion of Bub1 or CENP-U sensitizes cells to the inhibition of Plk1 but not Aurora B kinase activity. Taken together, our findings provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of kinetochore function, which may have implications for targeted treatment of cancer cells with mutations perturbing kinetochore recruitment of Plk1 by Bub1 or the CENP-O complex.

One of the strongest comorbidities in Autism is gastrointestinal issues. Gastrointestinal issues are also prevalent in individuals with mutations in CHD8, which is one of the top autism-related genes. However, the relationship between autism related genes, such as CHD8, gastrointestinal function, and autism related behaviors are yet very unclear. In this study our goal is to explore the molecular mechanism and connection between CHD8 KO and gastrointestinal problems.

The presence of oxidized DNA lesions, such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (AP sites), has been described as epigenetic signals that are involved in gene expression control. In mammals, Apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/Redox factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) is the main AP endonuclease of the base excision repair (BER) pathway and is involved in active demethylation processes. In addition, APE1/Ref-1, through its redox function, regulates several transcriptional factors. However, the transcriptional control targets of each APE1 function are not completely known. In this study, a transcriptomic approach was used to investigate the effects of chemical inhibition of APE1/Ref-1 redox or DNA repair functions by E3330 or methoxyamine (MX) in an inflammatory cellular model. Under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, both E3330 and MX reduced the expression of some cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, E3330 treatment reduced cell viability after 48 h of the treatment. Genes related to inflammatory response and mitochondrial processes were downregulated in both treatments. In the E3330 treatment, RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis genes were downregulated, while they were upregulated in the MX treatment. Furthermore, in the E3330 treatment, the cellular stress response was the main upregulated process, while the cellular macromolecule metabolic process was observed in MX-upregulated genes. Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) was predicted to be a master regulator of the downregulated genes in both treatments, while the ETS transcription factor ELK1 (ELK1) was predicted to be a master regulator only for E3330 treatment. Decreased expression of ELK1 and its target genes and a reduced 28S/18S ratio were observed, suggesting impaired rRNA processing. In addition, both redox and repair functions can affect the expression of NRF1 and GABPA target genes. The master regulators predicted for upregulated genes were YY1 and FLI1 for the E3330 and MX treatments, respectively. In summary, the chemical inhibition of APE1/Ref-1 affects gene expression regulated mainly by transcriptional factors of the ETS family, showing partial overlap of APE1 redox and DNA repair functions, suggesting that these activities are not entirely independent. This work provides a new perspective on the interaction between APE1 redox and DNA repair activity in inflammatory response modulation and transcription.

Moreover, we found that voluntary exercise restored hippocampal neurogenesis accompanied by the normalization of MDZ-perturbed transcriptome and ameliorated declined cognitive ability in MDZ-exposed mice.

Here, we conducted an RNA-sequencing profiling study of hiPSC-derived cell lines from schizophrenia (SCZ) subjects, most of which are from a multiplex family, from the population isolate of the Central Valley of Costa Rica. hiPSCs, neural precursor cells, and cortical neurons derived from six healthy controls and seven SCZ subjects were generated using standard methodology. Transcriptome from these cells was obtained using Illumina HiSeq 2500, and differential expression analyses were performed using DESeq2 (|fold change|>1.5 and false discovery rate < 0.3), in patients compared to controls. We identified 454 differentially expressed genes in hiPSC-derived neurons, enriched in pathways including phosphoinositide 3-kinase/glycogen synthase kinase 3 (PI3K/GSK3) signaling, with serum-glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1), an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, as part of this pathway. We further found that pharmacological inhibition of downstream effectors of the PI3K/GSK3 pathway, SGK1 and GSK3, induced alterations in levels of neurite markers βIII tubulin and fibroblast growth factor 12, with differential effects in patients compared to controls. While demonstrating the utility of hiPSCs derived from multiplex families to identify significant cell-specific gene network alterations in SCZ, these studies support a role for disruption of PI3K/GSK3 signaling as a risk factor for SCZ."

EVs are particularly enriched with miRNA, and the nervous system expresses approximately 70% of all miRNA. miRNA typically regulate gene expression via degrading or suppressing mRNA translation, and these small non-coding RNAs, which are thought to be shuttled between cells via EVs, have been implicated in a host of diseases and conditions, including depression and cognitive decline. To our knowledge, however, this is the first study to examine brain-derived (bd) EV miRNA content in a preclinical model of HIV-associated CI and depression.

Clinical immunity develops in residents of malaria endemic regions which confers reduced clinical symptoms during infection and protects against severe disease. We hypothesized that understanding the immune mechanisms of clinical immunity could inform vaccine design to improve efficacy. We compared the peripheral blood cellular and humoral immune responses during Pf malaria infection between clinically susceptible and protected participants from a malaria endemic region in Malawi during a prospective 18-month longitudinal study. Participant classifications were defined by the number of recurrent clinical malaria episodes with susceptible participants having more than three while protected less than one episode during the study period. Protected participants exhibited higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) breadth and titers against Pf antigens, and greater antibody (Ab)-dependent Pf opsonization compared to susceptible participants, consistent with our classifications. Using high dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and spectral flow cytometry, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses, we identified expanded memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes in the blood of protected participants undergoing malaria infection. These cells express a strong cytolytic T helper 1 effector program with transcripts encoding granzymes (A, B, H, M), granulysin, NKG7 and the ZEB2 master transcriptional regulator of terminally differentiated effector T cells. ZEB2+ memory CD4+ T cells were CD39hiTIGIThi and expressed multiple chemotactic and inhibitory receptors. Yet, their levels of several chemokine and checkpoint inhibitory receptors were reduced in protected compared to susceptible individuals. We propose that clonally expanded ZEB2+ cytolytic memory CD4+ Th1 cells could represent essential contributors to clinical immunity against Pf malaria infection.

Transcriptomic analyses revealed mostly convergent alterations in the gene expression patterns when PBC and PSC were compared to normal, age- and sex-matched controls. Gene Ontology (GO) term analyses of the modulated mRNAs revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in inflammation, immune response and chemotaxis of different leukocyte subsets . The expression of genes listed under the GO terms “inflammation” and “neutrophil” was not significantly different (p>0.5, Student t-test) between PBC and PSC. In sharp contrast, genes listed under the GO terms “T cell” and “B cell” were significantly (p<0.05, Student t-test) upregulated in PBC compared to PSC livers. Deeper analysis of the aforementioned liver RNA-seq dataset indicated that several genes specifically involved in Th1 and Tc1 responses were upregulated in PBC livers with respect to controls and, in some cases also with respect to PSC. Especially, this applies to Tc1-related genes encoding the markers CD8a, CD274 (best known as PD-L1), UL16 binding protein 1 (ULBP1), IFNγ, G Protein-Coupled Receptor 18 (GPR18), the transcription factor suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), and the cytotoxic protease granzyme B (GzmB) (Paillet et al, J Exp Med, 2021).

GSE175913	2021.08.28	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	39	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			CD11c+ Expression Associates with IFN-λ Responsiveness in Human B cells with clinical implications for SLE	Type I interferon (IFN), namely IFN- α, and B cell aberrations are long recognized in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. Type I IFN receptor blockade has undergone clinical trials in SLE with varying degrees of success. Type III IFN (IFN-λ) produce a gene signature currently indistinguishable from that of type I in responsive cell types. IFN-λ are not blocked by type I IFN receptor blockade as they utilize a unique receptor (IFNLR1). Type III IFN are appreciated to have an important role in viral infection at epithelial barriers where IFNLR1 is strongly expressed.  The effects of IFN-λ on immune cells remain understudied and are different between human and murine models.  We have previously shown that human B cells can transcribe type I IFN genes after IFN-λ treatment including those associated with SLE. We have found that IFN-λ is detected in the serum of human SLE patients and correlates with IgD- CD27- CD21- CD24- (DN2) B cells, a compartment which contains CD11c+ age/autoimmunity B cells (ABC).  ABC are a target of interest as recent studies suggest they are poised for plasma cell differentiation and enriched in autoreactivity and thus have the potential to contribute to SLE pathogenesis. Results: Naïve and DN cells display a prominent type I IFN gene expression profile in SLE. Transcript for type I, type II, and type III IFN receptors (IFNAR1, IFNAR2, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IFNLR1, and IL10RB) are detected in HD and SLE B cells. CD11c+ CD21- frequency increased in DN compared to naïve B cells for SLE and HD (both p< 0.001). The mean and range of CD11c+ CD21- frequency was higher in SLE DN (30.7± 9.5%, mean±SEM; range 4.8-74.7%) compared to HD DN (7.6%±1.0%,3.6-9.4%). Increased IFNLR1 transcript correlated with CD11c+ CD21- B cell expansion (r2=0.922, p<0.0001). Increased pSTAT1 after IFN-α2 treatment is found in monocytes, T cells, and B cells but only in the B cells after IFN-λ1 treatment. Naïve, DN, switched, and unswitched memory HD B cells are responsive to type I and type III IFN, but demonstrated a higher pSTAT1 fold change with type I IFN treatment compared to type III IFN. In all B cell subsets, CD11c+ cells had a higher pSTAT1 fold change after IFN-λ1 stimulation than did CD11c- B cells. In HD with well-defined populations of CD11c+ CD21- DN cells, pSTAT1 fold change for IFN-λ approached that of IFN-α2. Conclusions: All human B cell subsets defined by CD27 and IgD respond to IFN-α and IFN-λ, but those expressing CD11c+ have increased responsiveness to IFN-λ. CD11c+ cells expand in SLE and associate with autoreactive plasma cell development. Thus, the role of IFN-λ may take on increased clinical significance in the setting type I IFN receptor blockade. These results suggest IFN-λ is an underappreciated driver of the IFN signature and B cell aberrations in SLE.

Here, we use human trophoblast stem cells to elucidate the function of the transcription factor MSX2 in trophoblast specification. We show that depletion of MSX2 de-represses the syncytiotrophoblast program, while forced expression of MSX2 blocks it. We demonstrate that a large proportion of the affected genes are directly bound and regulated by MSX2 and identify components of the SWI/SNF complex as its strong interactors.

Ecto-5’-nucleotidase CD73 expression in four subsets of memory T cells decreases with aging. The resistance to apoptosis and high expression of IL7R entitle CD73+ memory T cells to be long-lived population. We found antigen-specific memory T cells have overwhelming CD73 expression. The transcriptional and chromatin accessibility profiles indicate the elevated effector functions in CD73+ memory CD4 T cells comparing to CD73- counterparts. Homer analysis and Transcriptional factor (TF)-regulatory element-target gene triplet network clearly show the crucial role of RUNT and NR family TFs in CD73+ cells. Furthermore, CD73+ memory CD4 T cells were prone to differentiate into TRM-like cells under in-vitro sequential TCR and TGF/IL-15 signaling. The decreased percentage of CD73+ memory T cells with age leads to the less replenishment of TRM cells from peripheral blood.

Here, we report that MeCP2 is a new subunit of a higher-order multiunit protein complex Rbfox/LASR and acts as a scaffold for this splicing complex. Deletion or mutation of MeCP2 leads to defects in forming MeCP2/Rbfox/LASR complex and aberrant alternative pre-mRNA splicing.

In this study, we found that a small number of TCF1+ tumor-specific CD8+ T cells were present in lung tumors throughout their development. Yet, most intratumoral T cells differentiated as tumors progressed, corresponding with an immunologic shift in the tumor microenvironment (TME) from “hot” (T cell-inflamed) to “cold” (non-T cell-inflamed). By contrast, most tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (dLNs) had functions and gene expression signatures similar to TSL from chronic LCMV infection, and this population was stable over time, despite the changes in the TME. dLN T cells were the developmental precursors of, and were clonally related to, their more-differentiated intratumoral counterparts. Our data support the hypothesis that dLN T cells are the developmental precursors of the TCF1+ T cells in tumors which are maintained by continuous migration. Finally, CD8+ T cells similar to TSL were also present in LNs from lung adenocarcinoma patients, suggesting a similar model may be relevant in human disease. Thus, we propose that the dLN TSL reservoir has a critical function in sustaining antitumor T cells during tumor development and protecting them from the terminal differentiation that occurs in the TME. Methods: We analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing to assess the differentiation state and trajectory of the cell subsets present after FACs sorting on endogenous GP33-specific CD8+ T cells from tumors and draining lymph nodes of tumor-bearing KP-NINJA mice, comparing them to GP33-specific CD8+ T cells from spleens of mice infected with acute or chronic LCMV.

However, dysfunctional microglia can have a negative impact on the structural and functional integrity of the retina under native and pathological conditions. In this study, we used interferon-regulating factor 8 (Irf8)-deficient mice to determine the transcriptional profile, morphology, and temporal-spatial distribution of microglia lacking Irf8 and to examine the effects on retinal development, tissue homeostasis, and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) formation. We hereby found a severely altered morphological phenotype accompanied by loss of microglia signature genes in IRF8 deficient microglia. An in-depth characterization by funduscopy, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography and electroretinography revealed no major retinal abnormalities. However, in the laser-induced CNV model, Irf8-deficient microglia showed increased activity of biological processes critical for inflammation and cell adhesion and reduced cell number near the lesions, which was associated with significantly increased CNV lesion size. Our results suggest that Irf8 has negligible functions in the steady state but is critical in converting resident microglia to a reactive phenotype under pathologic conditions and thus can suppress retinal inflammation and CNV formation.		untreated;rMG Irf8 KO with laser;laser;rMG Irf8 KO without laser

Background: Capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Although this therapy generally reduces the incidence of CRC recurrence and mortality, it can cause various chemotherapy-related adverse events (CRAEs), one of the most frequent of which is hand-foot syndrome (HFS). Most of the currently available HFS prediction markers focus on the pharmacokinetic parameters of drugs or their metabolites, yet our understanding of the biomolecular mechanism of HFS remains limited. Methods: We conducted an integrated multi-omics analysis of 63 Chinese patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) who had chemotherapy related adcerse effect (CRAE) records during adjuvant chemotherapy. The metabolomic profiles for each of plasma, urine, and colorectal tissue as well as profiles for colorectal-tissue transcriptomics and genome methylation were analyzed based on samples collected before and during surgery. Results: Susceptibility to HFS was found to be associated with profibrotic changes in several aspects of cellular biochemistry and physiology, characterized by reduced nucleotide salvage (indicating potential tissue damage, elevated spermine release, increased M2 macrophage polarization, and hypermethylation of genes for collagen formation. All these aspects were found to promote fibrosis, even before patients received chemotherapeutic drugs or developed any HFS symptoms. Additionally, we developed and validated relevant biomarkers with reasonably good discrimination performance and a high AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) value, i.e., from 0.848 to 1.000. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that a profibrotic phenotype characterized by multi-omics variation in colorectal tissue, plasma, and urine is closely related to the susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced HFS. Our findings provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying HFS.		21.26;19.26;Male;1.68;24.16;23.05;1.65;1.66;1.62;24.51;27.46;27.43;22.31;23.44;20.2;23.88;1.58;1.59;24.8;1.71;20.28;18.69;1.78;24.28;22.49;1.74;1.75;19.71;1.72;1.73;23.94;19.81;23.53;22.41;24.22;22.86;23.11;1.69;1.5;1.6;1.7;25.71;21.48;19.03;21.47;19.02;19.49;21.45;1.45;18.31;23.26;1.85;unknown;25.42;27.27;24.77;29.07;24.34;23.23;20.76;Female;20.72;25.4;1.57;24.49;1.55;colorectal tumor adjacent normal tissue;1.52;29.14;24.86;24.89;21.97;19.1

However, due to the acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, even third generation Osimertinib, the patients suffer poor prognosis. The resistance mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that increased expression of MUSASHI-2 (MSI2), an RNA binding protein, is novel mechanisms for resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We found that after long-exposure of gefitinib, the first generation EGFR-TKI, lung cancer cells harboring the EGFR-TKI-sensitive mutations became resistant to not only gefitinib but also Osimertinib. Although other mutations in EGFR were not found, expression levels of Nanog, a stemness core protein, and activities of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) were increased, suggesting that cancer stem-like properties were increased. Transcriptome analysis revealed that MSI2 was among the top list of the stemness-related genes upregulated in the EGFR-TKI-resistant cells. Knockdown of MSI2 reduced cancer stem-like properties, including expression levels of Nanog a core stemness factor. We demonstrate that knockdown of MSI2 restored sensitivity to Osimertinib or gefitinib in the EGFR-TKI-resistant cells to the similar levels of the parental cells in vitro. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay revealed that antibodies against MSI2 bound to Nanog mRNA, suggesting that MSI2 increases Nanog expression by binding to Nanog mRNA. Moreover, overexpression of MSI2 or Nanog conferred resistance to Osimertinib or gefitinib in parental cells. Finally, knockdown of MSI2 greatly increased sensitivity to Osimertinib in vivo. Collectively, our findings provide proof-of-principle that targeting MSI2-Nanog axis in combination with EGFR-TKIs would effectively prevent emergence of acquired resistance.

To systematically elucidate mechanisms controlling protein expression and turnover, we developed a CRISPR screening assay based on time-controlled Cas9 mutagenesis, intracellular immunostaining, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) that enables the identification of regulatory factors independent of their effects on cellular fitness. We pioneered this approach by systematically probing the regulation of the transcription factor MYC, a master regulator of cell growth1-3. Our screens uncover a highly conserved protein, AKIRIN2, that is essentially required for nuclear protein degradation. We found that AKIRIN2 forms homodimers that directly bind to fully assembled 20S proteasomes to mediate their nuclear import. During mitosis, proteasomes are excluded from condensing chromatin and re-imported into newly formed daughter nuclei in a highly dynamic, AKIRIN2-dependent process. Cells undergoing mitosis in the absence of AKIRIN2 become devoid of nuclear proteasomes, rapidly causing accumulation of MYC and other nuclear proteins. Collectively, our study reveals a dedicated pathway controlling the nuclear import of proteasomes in vertebrates and establishes a scalable approach to decipher regulators in essential cellular processes.

Here, we demonstrate that androgens regulate Shh-signaling to control the cellular niche in prostatic epithelial development. Selective deletion of androgen receptor (AR) in stromal Shh-responsive cells significantly impedes pubertal prostatic epithelial morphogenesis and growth. Dysregulation of developmental signaling networks revealed in both prostatic stromal and epithelial cells of AR-deficient mice. Specifically, deletion of AR yielded increased Gli1 expression in prostatic stromal cells, elevated Shh expression in adjacent epithelial cells and stark inhibition of prostate cell growth. Trajectory analysis revealed AR deletion induces abnormal differentiation patterns of prostatic epithelia. Recombination of prostatic epithelial cells with AR-deficient stromal Gli1-expressing cells fails to develop normal prostatic epithelia. These data demonstrate the decisive role of stromal AR in interacting with Shh-signaling in the cellular niche to control pubertal prostatic morphogenesis and growth.

WM is still an incurable disease, and patients succumb due to disease progression. Therefore, novel therapeutics designed to specifically target deregulated signaling pathways in WM are required. We aimed to investigate the role of FGF/FGFR blocking system in WM by using a pan-FGF trap molecule (NSC12). Wide-transcriptome profiling confirmed inhibition of FGFR-signaling in NSC12-treated WM cells; unveiling a significant inhibition of Myd88 also confirmed at protein level. Importantly, the NSC12-dependent silencing of Myd88 was functionally active, as it led to inhibition of Myd88-driven pathways, such as BTK and SYK, as well as the Myd88-downstream target HCK. Of note, both canonical and non-canonical NFB cascades were down-regulated in WM cells upon NSC12 treatment. Functional sequelae exerted by NSC12 in WM cells were studied, demonstrating significant inhibition of WM cell growth, induction of WM cell apoptosis, halting MAPK, JAK/STAT3 and PI3K-Akt pathways. Importantly, NSC12 exerted an anti-WM effect even in the presence of bone marrow microenvironment, both in vitro and in vivo. Our studies provide the evidence for using NSC12 as a specific FGF/FGFR system inhibitor, thus representing a novel therapeutic strategy in WM.

TML have recall expansion, self-renewal and differentiation capacity, similar to central memory (TCM) CD8+ T cells that arise in response to acute infection and persist long-term in the absence of antigen. An unresolved question is whether TML can also form memory. Here we showed that TML persisted in antigen free hosts. Further, in response to acute restimulation, TML expanded and differentiated inefficiently, but self-renewal and long-term persistence was not very different from TCM. Progeny of TML resembled conventional memory cells but retained multiple characteristics of chronically stimulated cells. This imprint was accounted for by the overexpression of the transcription factor Tox. Our findings demonstrated that chronically stimulated CD8+ T cells yielded memory that, however, differed from conventional memory formed in response to acute resolved infection.

GSE152514	2021.08.27	Mus musculus	GPL13112	TRUE	FALSE	3	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			The matricellular protein WISP2 is an endogenous inhibitor of collagen linearization and cancer metastasis	Collagen linearization leads to cancer metastasis and poor prognosis but there are no therapies to target it. In addition to cell-generated mechanical forces, collagen linearization is triggered by the interaction of collagen with WISP1 (CCN4), a TGFb1-induced factor secreted by cancer cells. However, it remains unknown how WISP1 is physiologically regulated and whether it could be targeted to prevent collagen linearization. Here, we show that WISP2 (CCN5), a secreted factor downregulated in tumors, is an endogenous inhibitor of type I collagen (Col I) linearization. Mechanistically, WISP2 prevents WISP1 binding to Col I, thereby inhibiting WISP1-induced Col I linearization. Consequently, restoration of WISP2 via overexpression in tumor cells or via treatments with recombinant WISP2 impairs WISP1-induced or TGFb1-induced cancer cell invasion and spontaneous metastasis in vivo. Overall, this study uncovers WISP2 as an endogenous competitive inhibitor of WISP1 and reveals that collagen linearization is controlled by secreted factors with antagonistic functions.		4T1 murine cell line;WISP2 OE

A variety of molecular mechanisms are at work to tightly regulate TfR1 expression, and abnormal TfR1 expression was associated with diseases. In the current study, to figure out the regulation pattern of TfR1, we cloned and overexpressed human TFRC gene in HeLa cells. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to analyze the global transcript level on overexpression-treated (OE) and normal control (NC) cell samples. 1669 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between OE and NC, and Gene ontology (GO) analysis for DEGs were carried out. It was found that lots of DEGs were associated with ion transmembrane transport and immunity. Moreover, the network was constructed on basis of DEGs regulating ion transport and immunity, the results revealed that TFRC was the node gene of the network, further suggesting that precisely controlled TfR1 expression might be not only essential for iron homeostasis, but also globally important for cell physiology, including ion transport and immunity.

Reactive astrocytes are attractive therapeutic targets as they sit central to many of the immune recruitment, injury response, and tissue healing processes of the spinal cord. However, methods of targeted expression of exogenous therapeutic genes within astrocytes must be validated to not alter the normal immunological involvement of astrocytes. To investigate the effect of transgene expression within astrocytes upon the immunological state of the contused cord, we injected the astrocyte-selective AAV5-GfaABC1D-dYFP reporter vector into an animal model of moderate contusive spinal cord injury.

However, studies focusing on the phenomenon and relationship between sex-specific placental adaptation and consequent altered fetal development are still elusive. Here, we established a prenatal maternal stress model by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to pregnant ICR mice at the mid-gestational stage. To verify the appropriateness of the animal model to study sex differences in the sub-optimal uterus milieu, pregnancy complications were examined. To elucidate global transcriptomic changes occurring in the placenta, total RNA sequencing was performed in female and male placentas. LPS exposure at the mid-gestational stage induced placental inflammation in both sexes. In utero inflammatory conditions resulted in intrauterine fetal growth restriction and impaired placental development in a sex-specific manner depending on the dose of LPS. Sex-biased placental pathology was observed in the junctional zone and the labyrinth layer. Placental transcriptome analysis revealed widespread disparity in protein-coding and long non-coding genes between female and male placentas, presenting the relationship between morphology and function in a sex-specific IUGR model.		whole placental tissues;whole placental cells;ICR;none;treated with LPS;treated with PBS

RNA-sequencing was performed on the neural retina and non-loade microspheres (NL-MSs) served as control treatment. The heatmaps of genes differentially regulated by Sp-MSs individuals as compared to NL-MSs showed a clear difference between the two conditions with 114 genes significantly regulated between the two groups, 27 significantly down regulated and 87 significantly up regulated (Log2FC ≥ 0,5, adjusted p<0.05). Pathway enrichment analysis using hallmark gene-set function highlighted 9 significantly regulated pathways: unfolded protein response, UV response, G2M checkpoint, allograft rejection, interferon gamma response, MTORC1 signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, MYC targets and adipogenesis (Figure EV 3B, C). Genes encoding proteins known to intervene in vascular permeability and retinal edema were counter regulated by Sp-MSs including Vldlr, Sesn2, Adcyap1, Dusp8, Pten, Slc7a1, Tjp1, Dlg1, Sema7a, although Vegf was rather up-regulated, suggested an anti-edematous mechanism independent from VEGF. The effect of Sp-MSs was confirmed by quantitative PCR for number of these genes demonstrating that spironolactone acts as a transcriptional regulator to normalize the diabetic retina.

Here, using H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) coupled with gene expression data (RNA-seq), we describe the active cis-regulatory landscape across more than seventy diverse CRC patient tissues, including tumor and native tissue. Analysis of the enhancers and super-enhancers with recurrently gained or lost activity revealed novel, clinically relevant insights into CRC biology. Computational reconstruction of core regulatory circuitry identified a master set of transcription factors which is responsible for tumorigenesis and the maintenance of normal intestinal function. Genomic studies have revealed four distinct consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) with divergent biology and clinical behavior and we reveal that differentially regulated enhancers and super-enhancers reinforced inter-subgroup heterogeneity. Our integrated analysis of enhancer elements in a large series of CRC patient paired samples reveals novel insights into cis-regulatory architecture, unrecognized dependencies, and cellular origins.

Tissue maintenance and repair depend on the integrated activity of multiple cell types. Whereas the contributions of epithelial, immune and stromal cells in intestinal tissue integrity are well understood, the role of intrinsic neuroglia networks remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover pivotal roles of enteric glial cells (EGCs) in intestinal homeostasis, immunity and tissue repair. We demonstrate that infection of mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus (H. poly) leads to enteric gliosis and upregulation of the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) gene signature. Single-cell transcriptomics of tunica muscularis (TM) showed that glia-specific abrogation of IFN-γ signaling leads to tissue-wide activation of pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs. In addition, disruption of the IFN-γ-EGC signaling axis enhanced the inflammatory and granulomatous response of TM to helminths. Mechanistically, we show that upregulation of Cxcl10 is an early immediate response of EGCs to IFN-γ signaling and provide evidence that this chemokine and the downstream amplification of IFN-γ signaling in the TM are required for a measured inflammatory response to helminths and resolution of granulomatous pathology. Our study demonstrates that IFN-γ signaling in enteric glia is central to intestinal homeostasis and reveals critical roles of the IFN-γ-EGC-Cxcl10 axis in immune response and tissue repair following infectious challenge. To characterize the response of enteric glia to helminth infection, we performed bulk RNAseq of tdT+ cells (=EGCs) and tdT- cells (=non-glia cells) from the TM of naïve and H. poly-infected Sox10CreERT2;Rosa26tdTomato mice.

Analysis of RNA content across a variety of EVs has shown differential miRNA enrichment when compared to parental cell expression patterns. Whether this is due to differential stability, specific regulation of miRNA export, or other mechanisms is unclear. Here, we tested whether RNA base modifications and recognition of those modifications might underlie differential miRNA export into EVs derived from KRAS mutant cell lines. We found that decreased levels of Mettl3, a writer of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, altered extracellular transfer of miRNAs containing consensus sequences for m6A. Further, EVs prepared from cells expressing shRNAs against Mettl3 were incapable of conferring colony growth in 3D to wild type KRAS cells. Our data indicate that m6A modification plays an important role in miRNA export to EVs.		knockdown;control;KRAS mutant colorectal cancer;Colorectal cancer cell line

Diffuse large B cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-DLBCs) have offered great promise for the diagnostics and therapeutics of CNSL leptomeningeal involvement. To explore the distinct phenotypic states of CSF-DLBCs, we analyzed the transcriptomes of CSF-DLBCs from seven CNSL-DLBCL patients using single-cell RNA sequencing technology. We defined CSF-DLBCs based on abundant expression of B-cell markers, as well as the enrichment of cell proliferation and energy metabolism pathway. CSF-DLBCs within individual patient have monoclonality with similar variable region of light chains (VL) expression. It is interesting to find some CSF-DLBCs have double classes of VL (lambda and kappa) transcripts. We identified substantial heterogeneity in CSF-DLBCs, and found significantly greater among-patient heterogeneity compared to among-cell heterogeneity within patient. The transcriptional heterogeneity across CSF-DLBCs are manifested in cell cycle state and cancer-testis antigens expression. Our results will provide insight into the mechanism research and new diagnostic direction of CNSL-DLBCL leptomeningeal involvement.

While the general signaling mechanism regulated by LPA-LPAR-signaling had previously been characterized, the global transcriptomic network regulated by individual G protein alpha-subunits in ovarian cancer pathophysiology remains largely unknown. To define the specific oncogenic networks regulated by LPA-stimulated GNAi2, GNA12, and GNA13 in ovarian cancer, transcriptomic analyses were carried out using SKOV3 cells in which the expression of GNAi2, GNA12, or GNA134 was silenced in an Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Comparative Genomic Hybridization 8x60 microarray platform.

Several organs and tissues can be in vitro cultured in 3D structures resembling in vivo tissue organization. Organoids culture contains most of the cell types of the original tissue and are maintained by growth factors similar to the in vivo situation. However, the system is yet not fully understood, and specific in vivo features especially those driven by cell-extrinsic factors may be lost in culture. Here we show a comprehensive transcriptome-wide characterization of mouse gut organoids derived from different intestinal compartments and from mice of different gender and age. RNA-seq analysis showed that the in vitro culture strongly influences the global transcriptome of the intestinal epithelial cells (~60% of the total variance). Several compartment-, age- and gender-related transcriptional programs being lost after culturing suggest that they are driven by niche or systemic factors. However, some of the transcriptional programs proper of the cells of origin are kept in vitro indicating that compartment-, age- and gender-specific intrinsic features exist and can be studied in this system. Our study provides knowledge about the cell-extrinsic or cell-intrinsic origin of intestinal epithelial transcriptional programs. We anticipated that our characterization of this in vitro system is an important reference for scientists and clinicians using intestinal organoids as a research model.

Using multiple myeloma as an example of an incurable lymphoid malignancy, we show how cancer cells modulate lineage restriction, adapt their enhancer usage and employ cell-intrinsic diversity for survival and treatment escape. By using single cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiling, we show that distinct transcriptional states co-exist in individual cancer cells and that differential transcriptional regulon usage and enhancer rewiring underlie these alternate transcriptional states. We demonstrate that exposure to standard treatment further promotes transcriptional reprogramming and differential enhancer recruitment, while simultaneously reducing developmental potential. Importantly, treatment generates a novel complement of actionable immunotherapy targets, such as CXCR4, which can be exploited to overcome treatment resistance. Our studies therefore delineate how to transform the cellular plasticity that underlies drug resistance into novel immuno-oncologic therapeutic opportunities.

How these chromosome organization changes occur and how they influence meiosis-specific chromosome events are not fully understood. Using Hi-C, we characterized chromosome architecture throughout mouse spermatogenesis at high temporal resolution. Our study revealed an intimate link between chromosome organization features and homolog pairing and alignment. We found that the meiotic chromosomes progressively reshape from TAD-like domains into linearly arranged loop arrays during prophase I. The transcriptionally active and inactive genomic regions exhibit distinct dynamics of loop growth, resulting in alternating domains consisting of shorter and longer chromosome loops. Such a domanial organization along meiotic chromosome axes is tightly correlated with the strength and precision of inter-homolog alignment. We further showed that a significant fraction of chromosomes near chromosome ends exhibit elevated inter-chromosomal association upon entering zygotene stage, while also exhibiting a higher degree of inter-homolog alignment. Using a mouse model defective in LINC complex component SUN1, we demonstrated that the prominent alignment of chromosome ends is dependent on the association of telomeres with the mechano-transducing LINC complex, but not the tethering of telomeres to the nuclear periphery. Taken together, our results suggest the 3D chromosome organization may provide a structural framework for the regulation of meiotic chromosome processes in higher eukaryotes.

Despite its devastating consequences, there are no treatments for liver fibrosis. Genome engineering and a human hepatic organoid system was used to produce the first naïve in vitro model including several crucial components contributed for liver fibrosis. Hepatic organoids engineered to express the most common causative mutation for Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD) developed abnormal bile ducts and hepatic fibrosis in only 21 days, which are the key features of ARPKD liver pathology. Singel cell level analysis indicated that the ARPKD mutation induced bile duct proliferation through several critial pathways, and appear to be actively involved in collagen fiber generation. Therefore, abnormal cholangiocytes promotes the expansion its counterpart , which collagen-producing myofibroblasts with a markedly increased level of PDGFRB protein expression and evidence of an activated STAT3 signalling pathway.

We also investigated whether the central-marginal EAT density ratio by the analyses of computed tomographic (CT) imaging could predict the central-marginal adipocyte diameter ratio in EAT. Methods and results: Left atrial appendage samples were obtained from 76 consecutive AF patients during cardiovascular surgery. EAT at central area (Central EAT) and that adjacent to atrial myocardium (Marginal EAT) were evaluated. Compared to the Central EAT, the dimeter of adipocytes was smaller, fibrotic remodeling of EAT (EAT fibrosis) was more severe, and the infiltration of CD3-, CD68-, or α-SMA-positive cells were more abundant in the Marginal EAT. EAT fibrosis positively correlated with adipocyte diameter in the Central EAT, while it negatively correlated with that in the Marginal EAT, resulting in the tightly positive correlation between EAT fibrosis and the ratio of central to marginal adipocyte diameter (C/M diameter ratio) (r=0.73, p<0.01). The C/M diameter ratio was greater in patients with persistent AF (PeAF) than in those with paroxysmal AF (PAF) (p<0.01). The CT density in Central EAT and Marginal EAT was measured and their ratio (C/M density ratio) was calculated. The C/M density ratio correlated tightly with the C/M diameter ratio (r=0.69, p<0.01). Conclusion: Our results suggest that C/M adipocyte diameter ratio was associated with fibrotic remodeling of EAT and progression of AF. Our results also suggest that C/M adipocyte diameter ratio could be accurately predicted by the analyses of CT findings noninvasively.		central;sample2, Marginal EAT;sample3, Central EAT;sample3, Marginal EAT;marginal;sample1, Central EAT;sample2, Central EAT;epicardial adipose;Atrial fibrillation (AF);sample1, Marginal EAT
GSE153835	2021.08.25	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Single-cell analysis reveals divergent responses of human dendritic cells to the MVA vaccine	Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a live, attenuated human smallpox vaccine and a vector for the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer. Efficient activation of the immune system by MVA partially relies on its encounter with dendritic cells (DCs). MVA infection of DCs leads to multiple outcomes, including cytokine production, activation of costimulatory molecules for T cell stimulation, and cell death. Here, we examined how these diverse responses are orchestrated in human DCs. Single-cell analyses revealed that the response to MVA infection in DCs was limited to early viral gene expression. In response to the early events in the viral cycle, we found that DCs grouped into three distinct clusters. A cluster of infected cells sensed the MVA genome by the intracellular innate immunity pathway mediated by cGAS, STING, TBK1, and IRF3 and subsequently produced inflammatory cytokines. In response to these cytokines, a cluster of noninfected bystander cells increased costimulatory molecule expression. A separate cluster of infected cells underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis persisted after inhibition of innate immunity pathway mediators independently of previously described IRF-dependent or replication-dependent pathways and was a response to early MVA gene expression. Together, our study identified multiple mechanisms that underlie the interactions of MVA with human DCs.		healthy donor;Uninfected;monocyte-derived dendritic cell;immature monocyte-derived dendritic cell;D1690;Infected (50 percent infection);D1689

However, few studies have identified transcriptional changes related to air pollutant exposure. Methods: RNA sequencing was used to examine transcriptomic changes in blood and cerebral cortex of three male and three female mouse neonates prenatally exposed to traffic-related nano-sized particulate matter (nPM) compared to three male and three female mouse neonates prenatally exposed to control filter air. Results: We identified 19 nPM-associated differentially expressed genes (nPM-DEGs) in blood and 124 nPM-DEGs in cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex transcriptional responses to nPM suggested neuroinflammation involvement, including CREB1, BDNF, and IFN γ genes. Both blood and brain tissues showed nPM transcriptional changes related to DNA damage, oxidative stress, and immune responses. Three blood nPM-DEGs showed a canonical correlation of 0.98 with 14 nPM-DEGS in the cerebral cortex, suggesting a convergence of gene expression changes in blood and cerebral cortex. Exploratory sex-stratified analyses suggested a higher number of nPM-DEGs in female cerebral cortex than male cerebral cortex. The sex-stratified analyses identified 2 nPM-DEGs (Rgl2 and Gm37534) shared between blood and cerebral cortex in a sex-dependent manner. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that prenatal nPM exposure induces transcriptional changes in the cerebral cortex, some of which are also observed in blood. Further research is needed to replicate nPM-induced transcriptional changes with additional biologically relevant time points for brain development.

Clinical trials to identify agents to treat AD have failed, and its underlying molecular pathology and etiology remain elusive. Neuroinflammation is thought to play a key role in the progression of AD. Emerging evidence has identified lower Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels as a major factor in neurodegeneration, especially in AD. NAD+ is an important metabolite in all human cells, as it is at the convergence of many central processes in cellular and mitochondrial maintenance, including DNA repair and mitophagy (the degradation of damaged mitochondria). Our previous work found that treatment of 3xTgAD mice with an NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR), can improve key AD features including tau phosphorylation and learning deficits in mice. Here we used the APP/PS1 AD mouse model to interrogate the effect of NR on neuroinflammation. Microarray analysis revealed major changes in pathways and genes associated with inflammation and the APP/PS1 mice had lower NAD+ levels than WT mice. Thus, seven months old mice were treated with NR for five months and their NAD+/NADH ratio increased. Brain neuroinflammation decreased as determined by decreased activation of astrocytes and microglia, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the brains of the APP/PS1 mice. NR decreased neuroinflammation by lowering the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB pathways. NR also attenuated DNA damage and apoptosis in the AD mouse brains. NR dramatically decreased senescence in the hippocampus and cortex of AD mice, relative to controls. Recent studies suggest that cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation are associated with DNA damage and senescence. cGAS-STING was activated in AD mice and decreases after NR treatment. Suggesting that NR can diminish neuroinflammation and senescence through the cGAS-STING pathway. NR treatment also greatly improved cognition and synaptic function in the APP/PS1 mice. We propose that the cGAS-STING pathway should be evaluated as a potential novel therapeutic target in AD.

To reprogram the functional capacities of CAR T cells, we inserted IL12 into the extracellular moiety of a CD28- CAR; both the CAR and IL12 were functional indicated by antigen-redirected activation and STAT4 phosphorylation, respectively. CD8+ T cells engineered with a IL12-CAR gained a so far not recognized NK cell-like RNA expression signature and a CD94+CD56+CD62Lhigh phenotype closely similar, but not identical, to NK and cytokine activated killer (CIK) cells. IL12-CAR T cells with specificity for CEA additionally acquired antigen-independent, HLA-E restricted cytotoxicity eliminating both CEA-negative and CEA-positive cancer cells in an antigen-dependent and independent fashion that was in contrast to conventional CEA CAR T cells. Simultaneous signaling through CD3 of the CAR and through IL12 were required and sufficient for inducing NK-like cytotoxicity. Overall, we present a prototype of a new family of CARs that harbor a cytokine integrated into the extracellular module in order to reprogram the functional capacities of CAR T cells towards augmented tumor recognition and elimination.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, single cell IgH gene sequencing, and protein-level validation across three large UC cohorts, we mapped the cellular and clonotypic landscape of mucosal and circulating B cells in UC. We found major perturbations within the mucosal B cell compartment, including an expansion of naïve B cells and IgG+ plasma cells (PC) with curtailed diversity and maturation. Furthermore, we isolated an autoreactive plasma cell clone from inflamed UC intestines. We also identified a subset of intestinal CXCL13-expressing T follicular helper cells that were associated with the pathogenic B cell response. Finally, across three distinct cohorts, we confirmed that changes in intestinal humoral immunity are reflected in circulation by the expansion of gut-homing plasmablasts that associate with disease activity and predict disease complications. Our data demonstrate a highly dysregulated B cell response in UC and revisit the role of B cells in disease pathogenesis.

Results: 5,186 genes had significantly altered expression (p<0.05) in WTb3 cells compared to EV cells (2,645 upregulated vs 2541 downregulated); 8,249 genes had significantly altered expression (p<0.05) in CAb3 cells compared to EV cells (4,094 upregulated vs 4,255 downregulated). However, 6,999 genes had significantly altered expression (p<0.05) in WTb3 cells vs CAb3 cells (3,524 upregulated vs 3,475 downregulated). Conclusions: Overexpressing of both a WT avb3 and a constitutively active avb3 integrin caused signficant alterations in the transcriptome of immortalized TM-1 cells, however constitutive activation of avb3 signaling had a more pronounced effect on the TM-1 transcriptome than did mere overexpression of the integrin.

Its organ function depends heavily on normal development. Numerous studies have focused on certain gene function changes during ovarian development, but systematic analyses of its molecular changes are extremely rare. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptional profile of the mouse ovary from 11 time points across multiple developmental stages, which enables us to explore the dynamics of ovarian development. By performing coexpression analysis, we identified gene modules with similar expression trends and determined 159 functional gene interaction networks based on machine learning. Most of these gene interaction networks are related to biological processes involved in the development of the ovary, which provides functional predictions for some genes with unknown functions and a reference for subsequent functional research. In general, our study provides a resource for understanding ovarian development.

Methods: RNA-seq has been performed on 22 high-quality CC samples, including 12 cystic CC and 10 fusiform CC samples, to search for molecular features. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify key modules associated with clinical subtypes. Bioinformatics analysis were conducted to elucidate potential mechanisms. Then, we constructed protein–protein interaction (PPI) network to identify candidate hub genes related to CC. Finally, we used the support vector machine (SVM) to eliminate redundant features and screen out the hub genes. The hub gene expression was determined in CC patients through quantitative real-time PCR. Results: For the first time, we have described the transcriptome characteristics of CC. These results suggest that cystic CC and fusiform CC have different molecular mechanisms. The bi-omics identified novel candidate genes and pathways might be helpful for personalized treatment and are of great clinical significance for CC.		cystic choledochal cysts;Ia;fusiform choledochal cyst;Ic;cystic choledochal cyst;fusiform choledochal cysts

Due to the delicate and complicated structure of the retina, the pathology of DR has not been completely elucidated yet. We constructed a transcriptome atlas of >14,000 single cells from healthy and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic murine retinas to decipher pathological alterations of DR. We found four stress-inducible genes Cirbp, Rmb3, Mt1 and Mt2 commonly induced in most types of retinal cells. Bipolar cells were little affected both in number and gene expression. There existed two subtypes of Müller cells, the Fos-expressing subtype and the no-marker subtype, and the latter lost more in DR. A large number of genes were deregulated in diabetic vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and the differential expression genes were paired to the pathways functioning in metabolism, shear stress and vascular permeability. These pathways were mapped by more differential expression genes in a subpopulation of ECs specifically presented in diabetic retinas (diabetic retinal ECs, DRECs). Moreover, several inflammation pathways were activated in DRECs, and the most significant one is the IL-17 signaling pathway. According to the EC markers, DRECs were mainly capillary ECs, confirmed by immunofluorescent staining of S100a9, a target gene of the IL-17 signaling pathway. This study deciphered pathological alterations of DR, and provided clues for new potential targets for DR therapy.

GSE176094	2021.08.24	Mus musculus	GPL21103	TRUE	FALSE	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			High-throughput sequencing of splenic B cells to evaluate the tumor transcriptome in Eµ-MTCP1 vs Eµ-TCL1 vs wildtype mouse models	Purpose: Karyotype screening in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has identified a rare chromosome translocation, t(X;14)(q28;q32), placing the mature T cell proliferation 1 (MTCP1) gene under transcriptional control of the immunoglobulin (IGH) locus. To establish the role of MTCP1 as a driving gene in CLL, we generated a novel mouse model (Eµ-MTCP1) which recapitulates overexpression of MTCP1 in murine immature and mature B cells. Eµ-MTCP1 mice developed a CLL-like disease found in the blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and other tissues. As the MTCP1 protein shares significant homology with the TCL1A oncoprotein, and the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model is widely used as an preclinical tool in CLL due to the development of a CLL-like disease in the blood, spleen, and other tissues, we aimed to evaluate the transcriptome between the CLL-like disease of Eµ-MTCP1 and Eµ-TCL1 mice. Methods: Transgenic Eµ-MTCP1 mice were generated on a C57BL/6NTac background at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Transgenic Mouse Facility via pronuclear injection of linear constructs derived from a plasmid vector encoding murine VH promoter-IgH-Eμ enhancer elements followed by human cDNA encoding the p13 kDa MTCP1 protein. Eµ-MTCP1 and Eµ-TCL1 mice were aged and monitored for development of CLL-like disease my monthly flow cytometry assessment of the blood. Upon reaching significant accumulation in the blood (>60%), mice were randomly chosen for euthanization and cell populations were isolated from the spleen according to previously described protocols. From this suspension, B cells were isolated using EasySepTM mouse pan B cell isolation kit (STEMCELL Technologies; Cat #19844). Cell pellets were captured and washed in PBS on ice prior to resuspension in TRIzol reagent and stored at -80°. Total RNA was isolated from TRIzol suspensions using a chloroform/ethanol extraction method and quantified via Qubit RNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen). The Clontech SMARTer v4 kit (Takara Bio USA, Inc.) was used for global preamplification. Illumina sequencing libraries were derived from the resultant cDNA using the Illumina Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-sequencing libraries were prepared with the Illumina Tru-Seq stranded kit and sequenced on a Hiseq 4000 targeting 40x10E6 fragments per sample. Transcript-level abundances were estimated using Salmon with the genocode mouse release 23, imported using tximport, with normalization and differential expression computed with DESeq2. Data processing was performed according to the CLEAR workflow, which identifies reliably quantifiable transcripts in low-input RNA-seq for differentially expressed gene (DEG) transcripts using gene coverage profiles. MiXCR (v3.0.5) was used with default parameters except the rnaseq alignment was replaced with kaligner2 to identify preprocessed reads containing CDR3 regions from B-cell heavy, kappa, and lambda chains, generating a list of unique CDR3 sequences associated with their relative abundances and specific V(D)J gene usage. MiXCR then generates a list of unique CDR3 sequences associated with their relative abundances and specific V(D)J gene usage. To verify expression of the human MTCP1 and TCL1 transgene (hMTCP1 & hTCL1) in mice, transcript level abundances were estimated using Salmon with a modified gencode mouse reference that contained sequences from human MTCP1 and human TCL1 genes extracted from the grch38 human reference. Results & Conclusion: Across splenic B cells isolated from both Eµ-MTCP1 and Eµ-TCL1 mice there was prominent usage of distinct heavy chain BCR gene loci in each mouse analyzed. In contrast, wildtype mice exhibited high degree of variability in heavy chain V gene usage without dominant emergence of any gene, indicative of a heterogeneous mixture of splenic B cells. Similar patterns suggesting clonal leukemic populations were observed by kappa and lamba light chain usage. The complexity and aggressive nature of human CLL is often stratified by IGHV mutation status of the malignant B cell population. The most abundant tumorigenic clones isolated from spleens of Eµ-MTCP1 and Eµ-TCL1 mice both exhibited low mutational burden in IGHV, well below the threshold for classification as “mutated." The low mutational burden in this region is consistent with the aggressive, IGHV-unmutated, subtype of human CLL. Moreover, we aimed to determine the overall transcriptional profile of these monoclonal tumor cells and to establish relation to that of the CLL-like cells in Eµ-TCL1 mice. Principal component analysis of the global transcription profile revealed distinct clustering of Eµ-MTCP1 and Eµ-TCL1 tumor cell transcriptomes along PC2, with significant segregation from wildtype littermates across PC1. Analysis of the overall gene expression pattern between Eµ-MTCP1 and Eµ-TCL1 transgenic strains revealed a significant overlap in genes most variable from B cells of wildtype animals. A considerable degree of overlap in gene expression was noted when directly comparing Eµ-MTCP1 and Eµ-TCL1 expression profiles, with a total of only 92 of 27,054 analyzed genes having significant variation (p<0.001) from one transgenic model to the other.

Many patients exhibit a primary resistance response after initial treatment. In previous studies, compared to acquired resistance, the mechanism of primary resistance is unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the response of patient samples to sorafenib by patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, and the difference between the sorafenib primary resistance group and the sorafenib sensitive group was analyzed at the single-cell level using single-cell sequencing technology. A special cell cluster may be differentiated by the liver bud hepatic cells, and the JUN transcription factors in this cell cluster were highly activated. The ALB is secreted by other cell clusters, and the cluster stimulates FcRn complex receptor to activate the HIF pathway and cell proliferation, resulting in poor response to sorafenib. These findings are validated by both cell communication analysis and experiments. Thus, the current studies provided a novel approach for the treatment of sorafenib-resistant HCC.

GSE173865	2021.08.24	Mus musculus	GPL18480	TRUE	FALSE	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE		34504786	A novel oral arginase 1/2 inhibitor enhances the antitumor effect of PD-1 inhibition in murine experimental gliomas by altering the immunosuppressive environment.	Malignant gliomas are common and aggressive primary brain tumors which are incurable by conventional therapies. Immunotherapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitors is not effective due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Clinical and experimental data show upregulation of Arginase1 (ARG1) expression in rodent and human malignant gliomas. The elevated ARG1 activity leads to depletion of L-arginine required for proliferation of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Inhibition of ARG1 in TME may unblock T cell proliferation and activate effective antitumor responses. To explore an antitumor potential of ARG1 inhibition, first we analyzed bulk and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from human and murine gliomas, and found upregulation of ARG1 expression in malignant gliomas, both in tumor cells and in tumor infiltrating microglia, monocytes/macrophages. We employed the novel, selective arginase inhibitor - OAT-1746 to interfere with microglia-induced glioma invasion in microglia-glioma co-cultures. We determined its antitumor efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination with immunotherapy. In a Matrigel invasion assay OAT-1746 blocked microglia-dependent invasion of U87-MG and LN18 glioma cells better than reference compounds, without affecting cell viability. OAT-1746 effectively crossed the BBB and increased arginine levels in brains of GL261 glioma bearing mice. The compound reduced glioma growth and increased antitumor effects of the anti-PD-1 antibody. Treatment with OAT-1746 modified TME as demonstrated by profound transcriptomic changes visualized by RNA sequencing. Our findings provide the evidence that inhibition of ARG1 in tumor cells and myeloid cells in TME abolishes the immunosuppressive reprograming of myeloid cells and improves the efficacy of immunotherapy.

Expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) can reprogram somatic cells into iPSCs, even for species possessing no optimal culture condition. Here we explored whether expression of OSKM could induce and maintain pluripotency without specific growth factors and signaling inhibitors. Tet-On-OSKM/Oct4-GFP Mouse ESCs (mESCs) were derived from the embryos obtained after mating of Tet-On-OSKM mouse and Oct4-GFP mouse under the 2iL ( N2B27 plus MEK inhibitor PD0325901, GSK3β inhibitor ChIR99021, and leukemia inhibitory factor) condition. Tet-On-OSKM mouse was Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm1(rtTA*M2)Jae Col1a1 tm3(tetO-Pou5f1,-Sox2,-Klf4,-Myc)Jae/J(The Jackson Laboratory,011004), and Oct4-GFP mouse was B6;CBA-Tg(Pou5f1-EGFP)2Mnn/J (The Jackson Laboratory,004654).The culture medium of Tet-On-OSKM/Oct4-GFP mouse ESCs was switched from 2iL to N2B27 plus Doxycycline medium (OSKM medium), under which OSKM trangene was activated. These above cells switched from 2iL to OSKM medium were called OSKM-ESCs. Meanwhile 2iL-ESCs (continuely cultured in 2iL) served as the positive control group. 2iL-ESCs and OSKM-ESCs collected at selective days (d18, 25 and 38) after medium switch were collected for RNA-Seq. Moreover, Tet-On-OSKM mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were reprogrammed under OSKM medium (N2B27 plus Doxycycline) and 2iL medium, respectively. The resulting OSKM-iPSCs were reprogrammed and cultured under OSKM medium.The 2iL-iPSCs were reprogrammed under 2iL plus Doxycycline medium and cultured under 2iL medium (without Doxycycline)once clones were picked up.RNA-Seq of these above samples was conducted to analyze gene expression. We found that via continuous expression of OSKM,OSKM-ESCs and OSKM-iPSCs propagated stably, expressed pluripotency marker genes, and formed three germ layers in teratomas. Importantly, OSKM-iPSCs could produce gene-modified animals through germline transmission.Transcriptional landscapes of OSKM-iPSCs resembled 2iL-ESCs, and were more similar to those of ESCs cultured in serum/LIF.

The median survival is 3-12 months and no effective treatments are currently available. Immune-based therapies have failed until now, reflecting our insufficient understanding of the basic immunological mechanisms leading to MPE progression. Here, we show that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in the pleural cavity fuels the progression of MPE. We found that efferocytosis through the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL and MERTK in macrophages led to the production of IL-10. Using single cell RNA-Seq, we revealed that IL-10 is indeed produced by four distinct pleural cavity macrophage subpopulations characterized by different metabolic states and cell chemotaxis properties. In turn, IL-10 acts on dendritic cells (DCs) inducing the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1). Genetic ablation of AXL and MERTK in macrophages or IL-10 receptor in DCs or TIMP1 significantly reduced MPE progression. Taken together, our results delineate an inflammatory cascade – from the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, to production of IL-10, to induction of TIMP1 in DCs – that facilitates MPE progression. This inflammatory cascade offers a series of targets for therapies which aim at preventing or treating MPE.		malignant pleural effusion;Myeloid cells;pleural fluid

We recently discovered that additional modulation of signaling pathways with small molecules facilitates reprogramming to more primitive induced muscle progenitor cells (iMPCs). However, the mechanisms by which a single transcription factor drives differentiated cells into distinct developmental states remain unknown. We therefore dissected the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of fibroblasts undergoing MyoD-dependent reprogramming to either myotubes or iMPCs using a novel MyoD transgenic model. To this end, we performed RNA-sequencing for Pax7-nGFP positive (including high and low) iMPCs/satellite cells, cells undergoing dedifferentiation (i.e. Dox+FRG) or transdifferentiation (i.e. Dox) and cells overexpressing a wild type MyoD or a mutant MyoD (i.e. MN) in the presence of FRG. Our analyses elucidate the role of MyoD in myogenic reprogramming and derive general principles by which transcription factors and signaling pathways cooperate to rewire cell identity.

Here we found that the expression of autophagy protein 7 (Atg7) mRNA was dramatically upregulated in aged DG engrams, and led to the forgetting of contextual fear memory and the activation of surrounding microglia.To determine mechanism by which autophagy in DG engrams activates the surrounding microglia, mice were co-injected AAV-RAM-Cre either with AAV-Dio-Atg7-Flag or AAV-Dio- EYFP in dorsal dentate gyrus to overexpress ATG7 in the DG memory engrams. Microglia were separated using magnetic-activated cell sorting and subjected to RNA-Seq in dorsal hippocampus .Bioinformatics analysis shown overexpression of Atg7 in dorsal DG memory engrams caused an increase in the expression of Tlr2 in the surrounding microglia.Depletion of Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4) in DG microglia prohibited excessive microglial activation and synapse elimination induced by the overexpression of ATG7 in DG engrams, and thus prevented forgetting. Furthermore, the expression of Rac1, a Rho-GTPases which regulates active forgetting in both fly and mice, was upregulated in aged engrams. Optogentic activation of Rac1 in DG engrams promoted the autophagy of the engrams, the activation of microglia, and the forgetting of fear memory. Invention of the Atg7 expression and microglia activation attenuated forgetting induced by activation of Rac1 in DG engrams. Together, our findings revealed autophagy-dependent synapse elimination of DG engrams by microglia as a novel forgetting mechanism.		dorsal hippocampus;ATG7 overexpression;6-8 Weeks;control;C57BL/6;Microglia

GSE166675	2021.08.24	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			BMP receptor blockade overcomes extrinsic inhibition of remyelination and restores neurovascular homeostasis	Extrinsic inhibitors at sites of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neurovascular damage contribute to remyelination failure in neurological diseases. However, therapies to overcome extrinsic inhibition of remyelination are not widely available and the dynamics of glial progenitor niche remodeling at site of neurovascular dysfunction are largely unknown. By integrating in vivo two-photon (2P) imaging co-registered with electron microscopy and transcriptomics in chronic neuroinflammatory lesions, we found repressed anticoagulation pathways in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) that clustered perivascularly at sites of limited remyelination with deposition of fibrinogen, a blood coagulation factor abundantly deposited in multiple sclerosis lesions. By developing the OPC-X-screen to identify compounds that promote remyelination in the presence of extrinsic inhibitors, we showed that known promyelinating drugs did not rescue extrinsic inhibition of remyelination by fibrinogen. In contrast, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor blockade rescued the inhibitory fibrinogen effects and restored a promyelinating progenitor niche by promoting myelinating oligodendrocytes, while suppressing astrocyte cell fate with potent therapeutic effects in chronic models of multiple sclerosis. Thus, abortive OPC differentiation by fibrinogen is refractory to known promyelinating compounds, suggesting that blockade of the BMP signaling pathway may enhance remyelinating efficacy by overcoming extrinsic inhibition in neuroinflammatory lesions with vascular damage.

To build a context-dependent network with multiple omic layers, i.e., a trans-omic network, we performed phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics of murine liver for 4 h after insulin administration and integrated the time series. Structural characteristics and dynamic nature of the network were analyzed to elucidate the impact of insulin. Early and prominent changes in protein phosphorylation and persistent and asynchronous changes in mRNA and protein levels through non-transcriptional mechanisms indicate enhanced crosstalk between phosphorylation-mediated signaling and protein expression regulation. Metabolic response shows different temporal regulation with transient increases at early time points across categories and enhanced response in the amino acid and nucleotide categories at later time points due to process convergence. This extensive and dynamic view of the trans-omic network elucidates prominent regulatory mechanisms that drive insulin responses through intricate interlayer coordination.		10 week;IP of PBS;LiverInsulin_liver (left lobe);LiverPBS_liver (left lobe);IP of human insulin (0.7 U/kg; Sigma-Aldrich);C57BL/6J;Liver (left lobe)

Active caspases are expressed by chondrocytes within the growth plate and caspase inhibition in limb-derived chondroblasts altered osteogenesis-related genes. Caspase inhibitors were reported to reduce the severity of cartilage lesions in osteoarthritis (OA) and caspase-3 might be a promising biomarker for OA prognosis. Design: To provide an overview about impact of caspase inhibition on expression profile in chondroblasts, the whole transcriptome RNA sequencing was performed. Limb-derived chondroblasts were cultured with two different inhibitors, Z-VAD-FMK (FMK) and Q-VD-OPH (OPH). Results: The analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the expression of 252 genes in the FMK samples and 163 genes in the OPH samples compared to controls. Conversely, there was a significant decrease in the expression of 290 genes in the FMK group and 188 in the OPH group. Among the top up- and down-regulated genes (more than 10 times changed), almost half of them have been associated with OA. Both inhibitors displayed the highest up-regulation of the inflammatory chemokine Ccl5. In the presence of one or the other inhibitor, the most down-regulated gene was the one for mannose receptors Mrc1. Conclusion: The results of this investigation yielded not only a list of genes associated with OA as being up- or down-regulated, but also a comprehensive expression profile in primary chondroblasts after general caspase inhibition. Additionally, comparison of the inhibitory impact in the case of FMK inhibitor vs. OPH inhibitor was provided.		embryonic day 12;Chondroblasts;DMSO;FMK;OPH;Limb-derived chondroblasts

Obesity and body fat distribution are important risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Evidence has accumulated that this risk is related to intrinsic differences in behavior of adipocytes in different fat depots. LIM Domain Only 3 (LMO3) plays a crucial role in adipogenesis modulating the key adipogenic master switch PPARγ in human, but not mouse, visceral adipose progenitors; however, despite high expression in mature adipocytes, its function in these cells is currently unknown. Aims/Hypothesis. The aim of this study was to determine the potential involvement of LMO3-dependent pathways in the modulation of key functions of mature adipocytes during obesity. Methods. Based on a recently engineered hybrid rAAV serotype Rec2 shown to efficiently transduce both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), we delivered YFP or Lmo3 to epididymal WAT (eWAT) of C57Bl6/J mice on a high fat diet (HFD). The effects of eWAT transduction on metabolic parameters were evaluated 10 weeks later. To further define the role of LMO3 in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, insulin signaling, adipocyte bioenergetics as well as endocrine function, experiments were conducted in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and newly differentiated human primary mature adipocytes, engineered for transient gain- or loss of LMO3 expression, respectively.Results. AAV transduction of eWAT results in strong and stable Lmo3 expression specifically in the adipocyte fraction over a course of 10 weeks with HFD feeding. Lmo3 expression in eWAT significantly improved glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity, paralleled by increased serum adiponectin. In vitro, Lmo3 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake as well as mitochondrial oxidative capacity in addition to fatty acid oxidation. On a molecular level, LMO3 augmented PPARg activity, oxidative mitochondrial gene expression, which depended on and the expression of the PPARg co-activator Ncoa1, which was required for LMO3 effects on mitochondria and glucose uptake. In human mature adipocytes, LMO3 overexpression promoted, while silencing of LMO3 suppressed mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Conclusions. LMO3 expression in visceral adipose tissue regulates multiple genes that preserve adipose tissue functionality during obesity, such as glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and adiponectin secretion. Together with increased PPARγ activity, these gene expression changes promote insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, glucose uptake in addition to increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity, limiting HFD-induced adipose dysfunction. These data add LMO3 as a novel regulator improving visceral adipose tissue function during obesity.		3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate into matutre adipocytes fr a period of 7 days after which cell were infected with Adenovirus (Lmo3);3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate into matutre adipocytes fr a period of 7 days after which cell were infected with Adenovirus (LacZ);mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes;LacZ Adenovirus (control);C57BL/6;Lmo3 Adenovirus (experimental)

Here, we established NMOSD pain model by injecting anti-AQP4 recombinant autoantibodies (AQP4-Ab) generated from NMOSD patient’s plasmablasts into rat spinal cords and confirmed the development of mechanical allodynia. AQP4-Ab mediated extracellular ATP release from astrocytes and pharmacological inhibition of ATP receptor reversed mechanical allodynia in NMOSD pain model. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed microglia activation and IL-1β elevation in NMOSD spinal cord. Inhibition of microglia activation and neutralization of IL-1β also attenuated neuropathic pain in NMOSD rat model. In addition, the human CSF ATP concentration was significantly higher in the acute and remission phase of NMOSD than in multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorder patients. These findings indicate ATP, microglial activation and IL-1β secretion orchestrates the pathogenesis of NMOSD neuropathic pain.

Hypothesizing that EGFR mutations alter tumor-immune interactions, we compared tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes between EGFR mutant (EGFR-MT) and wild type (EGFR-WT) tumors through single-cell transcriptomic analysis. We found that B cells, CXCL13-producing follicular helper CD4+ T (TFH)-like cells, and tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM)-like cells decreased in EGFR-MT tumors. The NOTCH-RBPJ regulatory network, which is vital for persistence of TRM state, was perturbed, and the interactions between TFH and B cells through the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis disappeared in EGFR-MT tumors. Notably, the proportion of TRM-like cells is predictive for anti-PD-1 response in NSCLC.

The aim of this study was to determine the potential involvement of LMO3-dependent pathways in the modulation of key functions of mature adipocytes during obesity. Methods. Based on a recently engineered hybrid rAAV serotype Rec2 shown to efficiently transduce both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), we delivered YFP  or Lmo3 to epididymal WAT (eWAT) of C57Bl6/J mice on a high fat diet (HFD). The effects of eWAT transduction on metabolic parameters were evaluated 10 weeks later. To further define the role of LMO3 in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, insulin signaling, adipocyte bioenergetics as well as endocrine function, experiments were conducted in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and newly differentiated human primary mature adipocytes, engineered for transient gain- or loss of LMO3 expression, respectively. Results. AAV transduction of eWAT results in strong and stable Lmo3 expression specifically in the adipocyte fraction over a course of 10 weeks with HFD feeding. Lmo3 expression in eWAT significantly improved glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity, paralleled by increased serum adiponectin. On a molecular level, LMO3 expression in eWAT increased pathways indicative of adipogenesis and PPARg signaling as well as mitochondrial activity, paralleled by a suppression of adipose tissue fibrosis. In vitro, Lmo3 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake as well as mitochondrial oxidative capacity in addition to fatty acid oxidation. LMO3 overexpression promoted, while silencing of LMO3 suppressed, mitochondrial oxidative capacity in human mature adipocytes. Conclusions. LMO3 expression in visceral adipose tissue regulates multiple genes that preserve adipose tissue functionality during obesity, such as glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and adiponectin secretion. Together with increased PPARγ activity, these gene expression changes promote insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, glucose uptake in addition to increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity, limiting HFD-induced adipose dysfunction.

However, the molecular and cellular heterogeneity beyond the established D1 and D2 medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, which likely underlie its diverse functions, are not well understand. Here, we present the cell taxonomy of mouse NAc generated from single-cell transcriptomic profiling, which not only reveals a rich cellular heterogeneity within both NAc MSN and interneuron populations, but also identified tight correlation between the transcriptional feature and spatial distribution of NAc neuron subtypes, supporting the notion that functional heterogeneity of NAc sub-regions can arises from differential distribution of molecularly distinct neuronal populations. To further test this idea, we focused on a D1 MSN subtype identified from our analysis and demonstrated that these cells possess distinct anatomic location, neural connection and more importantly, behavioral function. Collectively, our work not only created comprehensive cell taxonomy of NAc, but also provided insights into how functional heterogeneity is embedded in this brain region.

This study examined the molecular mechanism of the side effects of cyclophosphamide (CPA), a commonly used anti-cancer drug for the treatment of leukemia, and determined how to suppress the side effects using an organ culture system. Treatment with CPA disturbed the growth of tooth germs by inducing apoptosis and suppressing cellular proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, organs cultured at low-temperature could avoid the CPA-mediated inhibition of organ morphogenesis and differentiation. Cap analysis of gene expression of CPA-treated tooth germ revealed that the expression of genes related to the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint were down-regulated in the CPA-treated tooth germ cultured at low-temperature. In vitro analysis revealed that low-temperature impeded Rb phosphorylation and caused cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. This can prevent the CPA-mediated cell damage of DNA replication caused by the cross-linking reaction of CPA. Our results revealed that the side effects of CPA on organ development can be avoided by maintaining a low temperature. Further, this study provides a new screening model for assessing the effects of anticancer drugs on organ development.

Trophectoderm on the other hand gives rise to the placenta. Naïve pluripotent stem cells are derived from the pluripotent epiblast of the blastocyst and offer possibilities to explore how lineage integrity is maintained. Here, we discover that Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) restricts an intrinsic capacity of naïve pluripotent stem cells to give rise to trophectoderm. Through quantitative epigenome profiling, we find that broad histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) hypermethylation is a common feature of naïve pluripotency across species. We define a previously unappreciated, naïve-specific set of bivalent promoters, featuring PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 concomitant with H3K4me3. Naïve bivalency maintains key trophectoderm transcription factors in a transcriptionally poised state that is resolved to an active state upon depletion of H3K27me3 via inhibition of the enzymatic subunits of PRC2, EZH1/2. Conversely, primed human embryonic stem cells cannot be driven towards trophectoderm development via PRC2 inhibition. While naïve and primed hESCs share the majority of bivalent promoters, PRC2 contributes to the repression of largely non-overlapping subsets of these promoters in each state, hence H3K27me3-mediated repression provides a highly adaptive mechanism to restrict lineage potential during early human development.

Long-term hyperglycemia may induce diabetic keratopathy (DK), which is mainly characterized by delayed corneal epithelial regeneration. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play regulatory roles during tissue regeneration. However, the molecular mechanism by which miRNAs influence epithelial regeneration in DK is largely unknown. In this study, we performed miRNA and mRNA sequencing of regenerative corneal epithelium tissue from streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic (T1DM) and wild-type mice to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. Based on regulatory network analysis, miR-223-5p was selected for subsequent experiments and Hpgds was then identified as a direct target gene. MiR-223-5p downregulation significantly promoted diabetic corneal epithelial wound healing and nerve regeneration. However, the beneficial effects of miR-223-5p inhibition were abolished by an Hpgds inhibitor. Furthermore, mechanistic studies demonstrated that miR-223-5p suppression ameliorated inflammation and enhanced cell proliferation signaling in DK. Taken together, our findings revealed that the regulatory role of miR-223-5p in diabetic corneal epithelial and nerve regeneration by mediating inflammatory processes and cell proliferation signaling. And silencing miR-223-5p may contribute to the development of potential therapeutic strategies for DK.		counterpart;post treatment 16 weeks;C57BL/6;regenerative corneal epithelium;C57BL/6 + STZ

We hypothesized that “mechano-hypoxia conditioning,” using mechanical loading such as dynamic compression (DC) and cyclic hydrostatic pressure (CHP), would enhance development of human meniscus fibrocartilage extracellular matrix in vitro. MFCs from inner human meniscus surgical discards were pre-cultured on porous type I collagen scaffolds with TGF-β3 supplementation to form baseline tissues with newly-formed matrix. They were then treated with DC or CHP under hypoxia (HYP, 3% O2) for 5 days. DC was the more effective load regime, and combined HYP/DC enhanced gene expression of fibrocartilage precursors. The individual treatments of DC and HYP regulated thousands of genes and combined in an overwhelmingly additive rather than synergistic manner. Baseline tissues were then treated with a short course of DC (5 vs 60 minutes, 10-20% vs 30-40% strain) with different pre-culture durations (3 vs 6 weeks). Longer courses of loading had diminishing returns in terms of gene regulation. There was a dose-effect for higher DC strains, whereas outcomes were mixed for different MFC donors in pre-culture durations. Finally, baseline tissues were conditioned for 3 weeks with mechano-hypoxia conditioning to assess mechanical and protein-level outcomes. There were 1.8 to 5.1-fold gains in the dynamic modulus relative to baseline in HYP/DC, but matrix outcomes were equal or inferior to static controls. Long-term mechano-hypoxia conditioning was effective in suppressing hypertrophic markers (e.g., COL10A1 10-fold suppression vs static/normoxia). Applied appropriately, mechano-hypoxia conditioning can support meniscus fibrocartilage development in vitro and may be useful as a strategy for developing non-hypertrophic articular cartilage using mesenchymal stem cells.

It is unclear how NTHi persists in the airway, however accumulating evidence suggests that NTHi can invade and persist within macrophages. To better understand the mechanisms of NTHi persistence within macrophages, this work developed an in vitro model of NTHi intracellular persistence using human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Dual RNA Sequencing was used to assess MDM and NTHi transcriptomic regulation occurring simultaneously during NTHi persistence. This work demonstrates that NTHi can invade and persist within human macrophages. Macrophages activate innate immune responses, whereas NTHi persistence was facilitated by transcriptomic adaptations in bacterial metabolic, stress response and ribosome pathways. This research provides transcriptomic insights into NTHi-macrophage interactions, enhances our understanding of how NTHi can utilise host immune cells to chronically colonise the airway and identifies potential bacterial gene pathways that may be attractive therapeutic targets		Infected (T, treated) sample at 24h (24);MDM_C_6h;Infected (T, treated) sample at 6h (6h);Monocyte-derived macrophage;Uninfected (C, control) sample at 6h (6h);Uninfected (C, control) sample at 24h (24);MDM_C_24h;MDM_T_6h;MDM_T_24h

Therefore, immunotherapies aimed at reprogramming the immune system have largely spread in the past years. We employed gene transfer into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to selectively express anti-tumoral cytokines in tumor-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages. We show that Interferon-γ (IFNγ) reduced tumor progression in mouse models of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and colorectal carcinoma (MC38). Its activity was dependent on the capacity of the immune system to respond to IFNγ and drove counter-selection of leukemia cells expressing surrogate antigens. Gene-based IFNγ delivery induced antigen presentation in the myeloid compartment and on leukemia cells, leading to a wave of T cell recruitment and activation, with enhanced clonal expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes. The activity of IFNγ was further enhanced by either co-delivery of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or by drugs blocking immunosuppressive escape pathways, with the potential to obtain durable responses.		untreated;Day12;BM;T cells;IFNγ_treated;Day17

Results: We identify a population of tumor-associated club cells that could be associated with prostate carcinogenesis and uncover heterogeneous cellular states in prostate epithelial cells marked by high androgen signaling states that are enriched in prostate cancer. ERG- tumor cells, compared to ERG+ cells, demonstrate shared heterogeneity with surrounding luminal epithelial cells and appear to give rise to common tumor microenvironment responses. Finally, we show that prostate epithelial organoids recapitulate tumor-associated epithelial cell states and are enriched with distinct cell types and states from their parent tissues.

The activity of lineage specific and signal induced transcription factors are regulated by chromatin accessibility and other epigenetic modulators. Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs. Acting through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), glucocorticoids directly repress inflammatory responses at transcriptional and epigenetic levels in macrophages. In this study, we identified bromodomain containing 9 (BRD9), a component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, as a novel modulator for glucocorticoids responses in macrophages. Inhibition, degradation, or genetic depletion of BRD9 in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM), significantly compromised their responses to inflammatory stimuli, such as liposaccharides (LPS), and interferons. A large portion of BRD9-regulated genes are also known to be regulated by dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of BRD9 is able to further potentiate the anti-inflammatory responses of dexamethasone, by further repressing the GR downstream targets. Mechanistically, BRD9 co-localized with a subset of GR binding sites. Depletion of BRD9 enhanced GR occupancy at a subset of its targets. Enhanced occupancy of GR at these sites is associated with further repression of inflammation-related genes. Collectively, these findings establish BRD9 as a key modulator of macrophage inflammatory responses, revealing the therapeutic potential of BRD9 inhibitors as modulators for glucocorticoids action.

GSE175394	2021.08.23	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Impaired GSH biosynthesis disrupts eye development and PAX6 function	Glutathione (GSH) is a critical endogenous antioxidant that protects against intracellular oxidative stress. As such, pathological alterations in GSH levels are linked to a myriad of diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration and cataract. The rate limiting step in GSH biosynthesis is catalyzed by the glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). The high expression of GCLC in the lens supports the synthesis of millimolar concentrations of GSH in this tissue. Herein, we describe the morphological consequences of deleting (knocking out) Gclc from surface ectoderm-derived ocular tissues (using the Le-Cre transgene; Gclc KO) which includes an overt microphthalmia phenotype and severely disrupted formation of multiple ocular structures (i.e., cornea, iris, lens, retina). Controlling for the Le-Cre transgene revealed that the deletion of Gclc significantly exacerbated the microphthalmia phenotype in Le-Cre hemizygous mice and resulted in dysregulated gene expression that was unique to only the lenses of KO mice. We further characterized the impaired lens development by conducting an RNA-seq experiment on KO and Gclc control (CON) mouse lens at the day of birth. RNA-sequencing revealed significant differences between Gclc knockout (KO) and Gclc control (CON) lenses, including down-regulation of crystallins and lens fiber cell identity genes, and up-regulation of lens epithelial cell identity genes. In addition, genes related to the immune system (e.g., immune system process, inflammatory response, neutrophil chemotaxis) were upregulated, and genes related to eye/lens development were downregulated. TRANSFAC analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the lens of Gclc KO mice implicated PAX6 as a key upstream regulator of Gclc KO sensitive genes. This was further supported by a strong positive correlation between the transcriptomes of the lenses of Gclc KO and Pax6 KO mice. Strikingly, the dysregulation of PAX6-regulated genes in Gclc KO mice was observed despite no change in the ocular localization of PAX6 or decrease in the expression of PAX6 in the lens. In vitro experiments demonstrated that suppression of intracellular GSH concentrations resulted in impairment of PAX6 transactivation activity. Taken together, the present results elucidate a novel mechanism wherein intracellular GSH concentrations may modulate PAX6 activity.

We investigated the role of LINC01133 in endometriosis, an lncRNA that has been implicated in several types of cancer. We found that LINC01133 is upregulated in ectopic endometriosis lesions. As expression appeared higher in the epithelial endometrial layer, we performed an siRNA knockdown of LINC01133 in an endometriosis epithelial cell line. Phenotypic assays indicated that LINC01133 may promote proliferation and suppress cellular migration, and affect the cytoskeleton and morphology of the cells. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes detected by RNA sequencing indicated that cell proliferation and migration pathways were affected in line with the observed phenotype. We validated upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cyclin at the protein level, which together with DNA FACS analysis indicated that the observed effects on cellular proliferation may be due to changes in cell cycle progression. Further, we validated upregulation of the protein kinase TESK1 at the protein level, and found a corresponding increased phosphorylation and therefore inactivation of the actin severing protein Cofilin, which may explain changes in the cytoskeleton and cellular migration. These results indicate that LINC01133 upregulation is associated with endometriosis, which may be due to its effects on genes involved in the cellular proliferation and migration pathways.

The tight regulation of microglia activity is key for precise responses to potential threats, while uncontrolled and exacerbated microglial activity is neurotoxic. Microglial toll-like receptors (TLRs) are indispensable for sensing different types of assaults and triggering an innate immune response. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) signaling is a key pathway to control microglial homeostasis and activation, and its activation is connected to changes in microglial activity. We aimed to investigate how CB2 signaling impacts TLR-mediated microglial activation. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of CB2 causes a dampened transcriptional response to prototypic TLR ligands in microglia. Loss of CB2 results in distinct microglial gene expression profiles, morphology, and activation. We show that the CB2-mediated attenuation of TLR-induced microglial activation is p38 MAPK-dependent. Taken together, we demonstrate that CB2 expression and signaling are necessary to fine-tune TLR-induced activation programs in microglia.

Here, we deconvolute regional heterogeneity in the human PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME), a long-standing obstacle, to define precise stromal contributions to PDAC progression. Large scale integration of histology-guided multiOMICs profiling with clinical data sets and functional in vitro models uncovered two microenvironmental programs in PDAC that were anchored in fibroblast differentiation states. These sub-tumor microenvironments (subTMEs) co-occurred intratumorally and were spatially confined, producing patient-specific cellular and molecular heterogeneity associated with shortened patient survival. Each subTME was uniquely structured to support discrete aspects of tumor biology: reactive regions rich in activated fibroblast communities were immune-hot and promoted aggressive tumor progression while deserted regions enriched in extracellular matrix supported tumor differentiation yet were markedly chemoprotective. In conclusion, PDAC regional heterogeneity derives from biologically distinct reactive and protective TME elements with a defined, active role in PDAC progression.		human PDAC CAFs;human PDAC CAF primary cultures

We have shown that Lgl is inactivated by hyperphosphorylation in glioblastoma as a consequence of PTEN loss and aberrant activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway; this contributes to glioblastoma pathogenesis both by promoting invasion and repressing glioblastoma cell differentiation. Lgl is phosphorylated by atypical protein kinase C in a complex with Par6 and either activated Cdc42 or activated Rac. Here we have investigated the role of specific Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors in Lgl hyperphosphorylation in glioblastoma. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout PREX1, a PI 3-kinase pathway-responsive Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is overexpressed in glioblastoma. Knockout of PREX1 in patient-derived glioblastoma cells resulted in a reduction in Lgl phosphorylation and this could be reversed by re-expressing PREX1. PREX1 knockout cells showed reduced motility and altered phenotype suggestive of partial neuronal differentiation; consistent with this, RNA-seq analyses of these cells identified sets of PREX1-regulated genes with roles in promoting cell motility and repressing neuronal differentiation. Knockout of PREX1 in glioblastoma cells derived from a second patient did not affect Lgl phosphorylation. These cells overexpressed a short isoform of the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor TIAM1; knockdown of TIAM1 in PREX1-knockout cells from this patient reduced Lgl phosphorylation. These data show that PREX1 links aberrant PI 3-kinase to Lgl phosphorylation in glioblastoma, but that TIAM1 can also promote Lgl phosphorylation in a subset of patients. While this shows redundant mechanisms for Lgl phosphorylation, PREX1 appears to have a non-redundant role in glioblastoma cell motility, as this was impaired in PREX1 knockout cells from both patients.

In this study, we combined bulk RNA/ChIP/single nuclei sequencing with circadian behavioral assays to investigate cellular identities in the SCN and explore how they react to photic stimuli. We identified 3 major peptidergic cells in the SCN, Avp-expressing, Vip-expressing and Cck-expressing cells.

The intracellular bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis invades the cytosol, hijacks host actin, and induces cell fusion to spread to adjacent cells, forming multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) which promotes bacterial replication. We show that type I interferon (IFN) restricts macrophage MNGC formation during B. thailandensis infection. Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) expressed downstream of type I IFN were required to restrict MNGC formation through inhibition of Arp2/3-dependent actin motility during infection. GTPase activity and the CAAX prenylation domain were required for GBP2 recruitment to B. thailandensis, which restricted bacterial actin polymerization required for MNGC formation.

GSE118978	2021.08.23	Rattus norvegicus	GPL6247	TRUE	TRUE	12	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Selective molecular responses of rat white adipose tissue according to the fasting stage	Prolonged fasting-induced changes in rat white adipose tissue (epidydimal) transcriptome White adipose tissue is a central place to energy storage and a major endocrine organ. However, adipose molecular mechanisms have been poorly studied during prolonged fasting. To fill this gap, the aim of this study was to decipher transcriptomic regulations in rat adipose tissue during phase 2 (lipid mobilization) and phase 3 (protein catabolism) of prolonged fasting compared to the fed state. We describe a regulatory transcriptional program in epididymal adipose tissue in line with lipogenesis repression during both phases, and that would favor lipolysis during phase 2 and repress it during phase 3. Such regulations notably involve selective (i.e. phase-dependent) changes in gene expression levels of lipases, lipid droplet-associated factors, and the proteins involved in cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent regulation of lipolysis. The mRNA levels of adipose-secreted factors were globally consistent with the repression of insulin signalling during prolonged fasting. Regulations of leptin and adiponectin levels could be related to their respective role in triggering refeeding during late fasting and controlling lipid metabolism. Specific responses reflecting adipose tissue inflammation, increased fibrinolysis and a possible protein catabolism-related energy saving mechanism were also recorded during phase 3. These data thus provide a comprehensive molecular basis of adipose tissue responses according to the fasting stage.

Emerging evidence suggests that redox factor NAD+ decline is a hallmark of aging and neurodegenerative diseases including glaucoma. Supplementation with NAD+ precursors and overexpression of the nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), the key enzyme involved in the NAD+ biosynthetic process, have significant neuroprotection effect on glaucoma. Among the three NMNAT isoforms, only NMNAT2 is enriched in neurons, especially in axons, however, its role in glaucoma is not well studied. Here we present the expression levels of the enzymes that involved in NAD+ metabolism in both naïve and glaucomatous mouse RGCs. Intriguingly, NMNAT2 is the dominant form of NMNATs in RGCs and only its mRNA level, but not NMNAT1 or NMNAT3, is significant decreased in glaucomatous RGCs. We then demonstrated proof-of-principal gene therapy strategy of restoring RGC-specific NMNAT2 and NAD+ levels by AAV2-mediated RGC-specific promoter mSncg-driven long half-life NMNAT2 mutant. This gene therapy strategy is further tested in two optic neuropathy models, traumatic ON crush model and ocular hypertension glaucoma model. RGC-specific NMNAT2 overexpression significantly promotes RGC somata and axons survival and preserves visual function in both models. Our studies suggest that the weaking of NMNAT2 expression in glaucomatous RGCs contributes to detrimental NAD+ decline and that modulating RGC intrinsic NMNAT2 level by AAV2-mSncg vector is a potent gene therapy for glaucomatous neuroprotection.		10 weeks;retina;wild type;retinal ganglion cells (RGCs);C57BL/6;naive;Silicone oil-induced ocular hypertension under-detected (SOHU) mouse model

Methods: mRNA profiles of Huh7-shNME7 and Huh7-shCtrl group were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Novaseq platform. Index of the reference genome was built using Hisat2 v2.0.5 and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using Hisat2 v2.0.5. featureCounts v1.5.0-p3 was used to count the reads numbers mapped to each gene. And then FPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene. Differential expression analysis of two conditions/groups (two biological replicates per condition) was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.16.1). The resulting P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate . Genes with an adjusted P-value <0.05 found by DESeq2 were assigned as differentially expressed. Clusterprofiler software was used to perform GO function enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differential gene sets. Results: We identified 873 differential genes, of which 420 were up-regulated and 453 were down-regulated. In GO enrichment analysis, the biological process is mainly in purine nucleoside triphosphate metabolic process and oxidative phosphorylation process. KEGG analysis shows that differential genes are enriched in thermogenesis and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis . Conclusion: Based on RNA-seq analysis, the regulatory network involved in NME7 in liver cancer is depicted.		Liver cancer;cell line;Huh7

Comparing the single cell transcriptomic profile of human PCLS after five days of culture to freshly isolated human lung tissue, we found striking changes in  endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cell programs, reflecting both injury and pathways activated in static culture, while  immune cell frequencies and programs remained largely intact and similar to the native lung. These baseline changes should be considered when utilizing PCLS as a model of the human lung.		lung;peripheral tissue;percision-cut-lung-slice;fresh

Its potential, however, has been limited by contact dermatitis that prohibits topical application. This paper characterizes a DMF derivative, isosorbide di-(methyl fumarate) (IDMF), which was designed to have anti-psoriatic effects without skin-sensitizing properties. We show that IDMF exhibits neither genotoxicity nor radiation sensitivity in skin fibroblasts and is non-irritating and non-sensitizing in animal models (rat, rabbit, guinea pig). Microarray analysis of cytokine-stimulated keratinocytes showed that IDMF represses the expression of genes specifically up-regulated in psoriatic skin lesions but not those of other skin diseases. IDMF also down-regulated genes induced by IL-17A and TNF in keratinocytes, as well as predicted targets of NF-κB and the anti-differentiation ncRNA (ANCR). IDMF further stimulated transcription of oxidative stress response genes (NQO1, GPX2, GSR) with stronger Nrf2/ARE activation compared to DMF. Finally, IDMF reduced erythema and scaling while repressing expression of immune response genes in psoriasiform lesions elicited by topical application of imiquimod in mice. These data demonstrate that IDMF exbibits anti-psoriatic activity that is similar or improved compared to DMF, without the harsh skin-sensitizing effects that have prevented topical delivery of the parent molecule.

Tissue maintenance and repair depend on the integrated activity of multiple cell types. Whereas the contributions of epithelial, immune and stromal cells in intestinal tissue integrity are well understood, the role of intrinsic neuroglia networks remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover pivotal roles of enteric glial cells (EGCs) in intestinal homeostasis, immunity and tissue repair. We demonstrate that infection of mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus (H. poly) leads to enteric gliosis and upregulation of the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) gene signature. Single-cell transcriptomics of tunica muscularis (TM) showed that glia-specific abrogation of IFN-γ signaling leads to tissue-wide activation of pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs. In addition, disruption of the IFN-γ-EGC signaling axis enhanced the inflammatory and granulomatous response of TM to helminths. Mechanistically, we show that upregulation of Cxcl10 is an early immediate response of EGCs to IFN-γ signaling and provide evidence that this chemokine and the downstream amplification of IFN-γ signaling in the TM are required for a measured inflammatory response to helminths and resolution of granulomatous pathology. Our study demonstrates that IFN-γ signaling in enteric glia is central to intestinal homeostasis and reveals critical roles of the IFN-γ-EGC-Cxcl10 axis in immune response and tissue repair following infectious challenge. To understand mechanistically how the IFN-γ-EGC axis regulates the intestinal response to helminth infection, we used scRNAseq analysis of the TM as an unbiased means to identify tissue-wide changes in cellular composition and gene expression associated with glia-specific abrogation of IFN-γ signalling.		infected;Tunica muscularis;adult;naive

The chromatin remodeling complex BAF with its catalytic subunit Brg1 was previously identified as an essential regulator of early B cell development, however, how Brg1 orchestrates gene expression during mature B cell activation is less clear. Here, we find that Brg1 is required for B cell proliferation and germinal center formation through selective interactions with enhancers. Brg1 recruitment to enhancers was associated with increased chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation of their coupled promoters following B cell activation and expression of cell cycle-associated genes. Accordingly, Brg1-deficient B cells were unable to mount germinal center reactions and support the formation of class-switch plasma cells. Our findings show that changes in B cell transcriptomes that support cell proliferation and GC formation depend on enhancer activation by Brg1. Thus, the BAF complex plays a critical role during the onset of the humoral immune response.		Spleen;Brg1fl/fl CD23Cre +/-;Brg1fl/+ CD23Cre +/-;Brg1fl/+ CD23-WT;B cells;C57BL/6

The goals of this study are to examine the transcrptional changes through RNA-seq after treatment with PNU-282987 in mammalian RPE cell culture that lead to the dedifferentation and generation of MDPCs in the adult mammalian retina. To validate the RNAseq findings, RT-qPCR was used. Finally, several genes that were identified were knocked out in RPE culture through a novel CRISPR/Cas12 system and the resulting activated supernatant was assayed for it's ability to cause neurogensis in the adult rodent retina. Methods: Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE-J) cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle control), nicotine (an α7 nAChR agonist that does not cause regeneration as a control), or PNU-282987, or MLA (an α7 nAChR antagonist as a control). The cells were treated for either 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 8 hours, or 12 hours. RNA was extracted from RPE-J cells using Zymo Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit and mRNA proflies were generated by GeneWiz with the Illumina NextSeq 550 high-output platform. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, GeneWiz mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the rat genome (Rnor6.0) and identified over 15,000 transcripts. Deseq2 analysis was performed to determine log 2 fold changes in gene expression compared to DMSO control, nicotine control, and MLA control, and found over 450 significantly differentially expressed genes. Twelve genes were validated with qRT–PCR to compare trends and were found to be consistent. Eight genes identified through RNA-seq involved in inflammation response, receptor signaling, WNT signaling and early retinal development were knocked out using CRISPR/Cas12 in RPE-J culture. Intravitreal injections of KO lines supernatant after treatment with PNU-282987 was assayed for invovlment of these genes in the adult neuroregeneration response. Conclusions: PNU-282987 activation of RPE causes signficant transcript profile changes in RPE-J cell culture that leads to significant differentially expressed genes as seen in RNA-seq profiles and validated with qRT-PCR. Further, several genes identified in the RNA-seq were found to be necessary for the neurogenic response as seen with generation of KO lines of RPE. Our study is the first to show that activaiton of the α7 nAChR on RPE leads to genetic changes sufficient to induce adult mammalian neurogenesis in the rodent retina and that several novel genes are invovled in this pathway in mammals as compared to other vertebrate models of retinal regeneration.

Gross morphological characterization showed translational relevance for understanding the viral neuropathogenesis and Zika-associated microcephaly in humans. Thus, an integrated, multi-omics (RNA-sequencing, proteomics) analysis of fetal brain tissues was performed to understand pathways perturbed by viral infection in developing brains. These analyses identified virus-induced defects in cell cycle progression and neurodevelopment, in S-phase DNA replication and NEUROD2/TBR2 transcription factor cascades, respectively. Among the most significant responses was induction of innate immune programs in ZIKV-infected brains, including immunoproteasome activation and MHC-I antigen display associated with immune cell infiltration and neuronal death during early development. Identification of specific components within major pathways contributing to viral infection-induced effects on neurodevelopment provides novel targets for therapeutic intervention against neurotropic infections and ZIKV-associated microcephaly specifically.

We recently established somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)-PSC lines and showed their stemness. In the present study, we produced SCNT-PSC-MPCs using a novel direct differentiation method, and the characteristics, gene expression, and genetic stability of these MPCs were compared with those derived through the EB formation method. The recovery and purification of SCNT-PSC-Direct-MPCs were significantly accelerated compared to those of the SCNT-PSC-EB-MPCs, but both types of MPCs expressed typical surface markers and exhibited similar proliferation and differentiation potentials. Additionally, the analysis of gene expression patterns using microarrays showed very similar patterns. Moreover, array CGH analysis showed that both SCNT-PSC-Direct-MPCs and SCNT-PSC-EB-MPCs exhibited no significant differences in copy number variation (CNV) or single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency. These results indicate that SCNT-PSC-Direct-MPCs exhibited high genetic stability even after rapid differentiation into MPCs, and the rate at which directly derived MPCs reached a sufficient number was higher than that of MPCs derived through the EB method. Therefore, we suggest that the direct method of differentiating MPCs from SCNT-PSCs can improve the efficacy of SCNT-PSCs applied to allogeneic transplantation.

Conditional knockout of both Bcl9 and Bcl9L resulted into tumor cell death. In contrast, disrupting the interaction of Bcl9/Bcl9L with beta-catenin, either by deletion of their HD2 domains or by a point mutation in the N-terminal domain of beta-catenin (D164A), diminished primary tumor growth and tumor cell proliferation and reduced tumor cell invasion and lung metastasis. In comparison, the effect of disrupting the HD1 domain-mediated binding of Bcl9/Bcl9L to Pygopus was more moderate. Interfering with the beta-catenin - Bcl9/Bcl9L - Pygo chain of adaptors only partially impaired the transcriptional response of mammary tumor cells to Wnt3a and TGF-beta treatment. The results indicate that Bcl9/Bcl9L critically enforce canonical Wnt signaling in its contribution to breast cancer growth and malignant progression.		4days;Bcl9/Bcl9L_deltaHD2/fl, MMTV-PyMT;no cytokine;Wnt3a;3days;Bcl9/Bcl9L_deltaHD1/fl, MMTV-PyMT;Bcl9/Bcl9L_deltaHD1/-, MMTV-PyMT;Bcl9/Bcl9L_deltaHD2/-, MMTV-PyMT;Breast cancer cells;Tumor developed in a thoracic mammary gland;MMTV-PyMT (FVB/N);TGFbeta

Furthermore, OEB treatment regulated lipid metabolism, activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors signaling pathway in mice with AILI, affected immune cells, and decreased neutrophil infiltration.

Here we show that the food amount is a major positive determinant of the gut surface area contributing to an increased absorptive function, reversible by reducing daily food. While several upregulated intestinal energetic pathways are dispensable, the intestinal lipid metabolism is instead necessary for the genetic and environment overeating–induced increase of the gut absorptive capacity. In presence of dietary lipids, intestinal PPARα knock-out or its pharmacological antagonism suppress intestinal crypt expansion and shorten villi in mice and in human intestinal biopsies, diminishing the post-prandial triglyceride transport and nutrient uptake. Intestinal PPARα ablation limits systemic lipid absorption and restricts lipid droplet expansion and PLIN2 levels, critical for droplet formation. This improves the lipid metabolism, and reduces body adiposity and liver steatosis, suggesting an alternative target for treating obesity.		proximal jejunum;Whole tissue;ob/ob;C57BL/6J

Using next-generation RNA sequencing and proteomics techniques, we identified 394 differentially expressed (DE) coding and long noncoding (lnc) RNAs as well as 213 DE proteins in Brodmann Area 9 of OUD subjects. The RNA and protein changes converged on pro-angiogenic gene networks and cytokine signaling pathways. Four genes (LGALS3, SLC2A1, PCLD1, VAMP1) were dysregulated in both RNA and protein. Dissecting these DE genes and networks, we found cell type specific effects with enrichment in astrocyte and endothelial correlated genes. Weighted-genome correlation network analysis (WGCNA) revealed cell type correlated networks including an astrocytic/endothelial network involved in angiogenic cytokine signaling as well as a neuronal network involved in synaptic vesicle formation. In addition, using ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging, we identified increased vascularization in postmortem brains from a subset of subjects with OUD. This is the first study of its kind relating dysregulation of astrocytic and endothelial angiogenic gene networks in OUD with ex vivo imaging qualitative evidence of hypervascularization in postmortem brain. Understanding the neurovascular effects of OUD is critical in this time of widespread opioid use.

Enzalutamide (ENZ) is a second-generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist employed for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPCa). A considerable proportion of tumors eventually develop resistance during treatment. Thus, agents that can overcome resistance to PCa are needed urgently. Ilicicolinal A (Ili-A), an ascochlorin derivative isolated from the coral-derived fungus Acremonium sclerotigenum GXIMD 02501, shows activity in human PCa cells, but its mechanism of action against CRPCa is not known. Here, RNA-sequencing showed the EZH2 pathway to be involved in PCa proliferation. Ili-A at low doses inhibited the transcriptional activity of EZH2 and AR targets by changing their protein expression. Interestingly, Ili-A suppressed the binding of EZH2 to promoter regions in AR/serine/threonine polo-like kinase-1/aurora kinase A. Moreover, low-dose Ili-A showed a synergistic effect with enzalutamide to inhibit survival of CRPCa cells in vitro, and enhanced the anti-cancer effect of enzalutamide on CRPCa xenografts with minimal side-effects. These data suggest that Ili-A could be used in combination with enzalutamide to treat CRPCa.

In this study, a combination of shRNA-mediated synthetic lethality screening and transcriptomic analysis revealed the transcription factors YAP/TAZ as key drivers of Sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by repressing Sorafenib-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, in a TEAD-dependent manner YAP/TAZ induce the expression of SLC7A11, a key transporter maintaining intracellular glutathione homeostasis, thus enabling HCC cells to overcome Sorafenib-induced ferroptosis. At the same time, YAP/TAZ sustain the protein stability, nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of ATF4 which in turn cooperates to induce SLC7A11 expression. Our study uncovered a critical role of YAP/TAZ in the repression of ferroptosis and thus in the establishment of Sorafenib resistance in HCC, highlighting YAP/TAZ-based rewiring strategies as potential approaches to overcome HCC therapy resistance.

Objective: To better understand the biologic role of cutaneous innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), we investigated their phenotypic and molecular features under physiologic (normal human skin [NHS]) and pathologic (lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis [AD]) conditions. Methods: Skin punch biopsies and reduction sheets as well as blood specimens were obtained from either patients with AD or healthy individuals. Cell and/or tissue samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing or subjected to in vitro / ex vivo culture. Results: Notwithstanding substantial quantitative differences between NHS and AD skin, we found that the vast majority of cutaneous ILCs belong to the CRTH2+ subset and reside in the upper skin layers. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cutaneous ILC-enriched cell samples confirmed the predominance of biologically heterogeneous group 2 ILCs and, for the first time, demonstrated considerable ILC lineage infidelity (coexpression of genes typical of either type 2 [GATA3 and IL13] or type 3/17 [RORC, IL22, and IL26] immunity within individual cells) in lesional AD skin, and to a much lesser extent, in NHS. Similar events were demonstrated in ILCs from skin explant cultures and in vitro expanded ILCs from the peripheral blood. Conclusion: These findings support the concept that instead of being a stable entity with well-defined components, the skin immune system consists of a network of highly flexible cellular players that are capable of adjusting their function to the needs and challenges of the environment.

GSE178683	2021.08.20	Homo sapiens	GPL18573	TRUE	FALSE	21	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE		34409038	Alginate-based 3D culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells and their differentiation to functional dopaminergic neurons	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent an unlimited cell source for the generation of in vitro models of patient-specific dopaminergic (DA) neurons, posing a possibility to overcome the restricted accessibility to disease-affected tissue for mechanistic studies on Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the complexity of the human brain is not fully recapitulated by existing monolayer culture methods. Consequently, neurons differentiated in a three dimensional (3D) in vitro culture system might better mimic the in vivo cellular environment for basic mechanistic studies and represent better predictors of drug responses in vivo. Thus, in this work we established a new in vitro cell culture model based on the microencapsulation of hiPSCs in small alginate/fibronectin beads and their differentiation to DA neurons. Optimisation of hydrogel matrix concentrations and composition resulted in high viability of embedded iPSCs. Neural differentiation capacity and DA neuronal yield, analyzed by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and western blot analyses, were increased in the 3D neuronal cultures compared to neurons generated using the conventional 2D culture system. Additionally, electrophysiological parameters and metabolic switching profile supported the increased functionality and an anticipated metabolic resetting of neurons grown in alginate scaffolds with respect to the 2D neurons. We also report long-term maintenance of neuronal cultures and mature functional properties. Furthermore, our findings indicate that our 3D model system can recapitulate mitochondrial superoxide production as an important mitochondrial phenotype observed in PD patients’-derived neurons and that this phenotype might be detectable earlier during neuronal differentiation. Taken together, these results indicate that our alginate-based 3D culture system offers an advantageous strategy for the reliable and rapid derivation of mature and functional DA neurons from iPSCs.

The HSC-primed HECs are peak at embryonic day (E) 10 and have been efficiently captured by the marker combination CD41-CD43-CD45-CD31+CD201+Kit+CD44+ (PK44) in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of mouse embryos most recently. In the present study, we investigated the spatiotemporal and functional heterogeneity of PK44 cells around the time of emergence of HSCs. First, PK44 cells in E10 AGM region could be further divided into three molecularly different populations showing endothelial- or hematopoietic-biased characteristics. Specifically, with the combination of Kit, the expression of CD93 or CD146 could divide PK44 cells into endothelial- and hematopoietic-feature biased populations, which was further functionally validated at single cell level. Next, PK44 population could also be detected in the yolk sac, showing a developmental dynamics and functional diversification similar to those in the AGM region. Importantly, PK44 cells in the yolk sac demonstrated an unambiguous multi-lineage reconstitution capacity after in vitro incubation. Regardless of the functional similarity, PK44 cells in the yolk sac displayed transcriptional features different to those in the AGM region. Taken together, our work delineated the spatiotemporal characteristics of HECs represented by PK44, and revealed a previously unknown HSC competence of HECs in the yolk sac. These findings provided a fundamental basis for in-depth studying the different origins and molecular programs of HSC generation in the future.		PK44 cells;E10.0

We characterized neuro-vascular organoids (iN-VOs) by single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to determine cell type composition and gene expression. Using droplet based scRNA-seq we analyzed over 26,000 cells across day 45 organoids grown under three conditions: 45 days of NEUROD1 overexpression (iN-VO, 45 Days Induction), 15 days of NEUROD1 overexpression (iN-VO, 15 Days Induction) and without overexpression (iN-VO, No Induction).

GSE182343	2021.08.19	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	45	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Hobit identifies TRM precursors that are regulated by Eomes	Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells (TRM) constitute a non-circulating memory T cell subset that provides early protection against re-infection. However, how TRM arise from antigen-triggered T cells has remained unclear. Exploiting the TRM-restricted expression of Hobit, we developed TRM reporter/deleter mice to study TRM differentiation. We found that Hobit was upregulated in a subset of LCMV-specific T cells located within peripheral tissues during the effector phase of the immune response. These Hobit+ effector T cells were identified as TRM precursors, given that their depletion substantially decreased TRM development, but not the formation of circulating memory T cells. Adoptive transfer experiments of Hobit+ effector T cells corroborated their biased contribution to the TRM lineage. Transcriptional profiling of Hobit+ effector T cells underlined the early establishment of TRM properties including downregulation of tissue exit receptors and upregulation of TRM-associated molecules. Importantly, we identified Eomes as a key factor instructing the early bifurcation of circulating and resident lineages. These findings establish that commitment of TRM occurs early in antigen-driven T cell differentiation and reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying this differentiation pathway.

GSE182338	2021.08.19	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	120	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity is a hallmark of aging breast epithelia and reflects a biology convergent with susceptibility to cancer initiation	Purpose: Leveraging genome-wide lineage-specific transcriptional profiling of human mammary luminal epithelial cells (LEPs) and myoepithelial cells (MEPs) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying aging-associated breast cancer susceptibility. Methods: Human mammary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells were isolated from finite lifespan, non-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) derived from primary breast tissue of women across different age cohorts and breast cancer risk profiles. Transcriptional profiles of LEP and MEP cells were generated via RNA-sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 2500. RNA-Seq reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic software, and the processed reads were mapped back to the human genome (hg19) using TOPHAT2. Count matrices were generated using HTSeq. Results: Genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity is a hallmark of aging breast epithelia. Age-dependent differential expression occurred almost exclusively in luminal cells characterized by luminal epithelial cells of older women expressing markers normally expressed in myoepithelial cells. Luminal epithelial cells from histologically normal breast tissue from younger women who carry germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 genes and who are considered to be clinically high risk for breast cancer also exhibited these hallmarks of accelerated aging. Furthermore, accelerated aging of these genetically high risk luminal epithelial cells could be predicted using a biological clock trained on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles of the luminal-specific ELF5 transcription factor. Conclusions: Our study shows that lineage-specific analysis is critical to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying aging-associated cancer susceptibility. Our results suggest that loss of lineage fidelity is a general manifestation of epithelia that are susceptible to cancer initiation. Moreover, breast aging hallmarks identified in our study reflect a convergent biology of cancer susceptibility, regardless of the specific underlying genetic or age-dependent risk.

Although MAIT cells are identified by a semi-invariant T cell receptor, their phenotypic and functional heterogeneity is not well understood. Here we present an integrated single cell transcriptomic analysis of over 76,000 human MAIT cells during acute and chronic antigen-specific activation with the MR1 ligand 5-OP-RU and non-specific TCR stimulation. We show that MAIT cells span a broad range of homeostatic, effector, helper, tissue-infiltrating, regulatory, and exhausted phenotypes, with distinct gene expression programs associated with CD4+ or CD8+ co-expression. During acute activation, MAIT cells rapidly adopt a cytotoxic phenotype characterized by high expression of GZMB, IFNG and TNF. In contrast, chronic stimulation induces heterogeneous states defined by proliferation, cytotoxicity, immune modulation, and exhaustion. We further demonstrate a FOXP3 expressing MAIT cell subset that phenotypically resembles conventional regulatory T cells. Moreover, scRNAseq-defined MAIT cell subpopulations were also detected in individuals recently exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, confirming their presence during human infection. Our study provides the first comprehensive atlas of human MAIT cells in activation conditions and defines substantial functional heterogeneity, suggesting complex roles in health and disease.

CUG960 RNA-expressing mice induced at postnatal day 1, as well as adult-onset animals, show clear, measurable muscle wasting accompanied by severe histological defects including central myonuclei, reduced fiber cross-sectional area, increased percentage of oxidative myofibers, the presence of nuclear RNA foci that colocalize with Mbnl1 protein, and increased Celf1 protein in severely affected muscles. Importantly, muscle loss, histological abnormalities and RNA foci are reversible, demonstrating recovery upon removal of toxic RNA. RNA-seq and protein array analysis indicate that the balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways that normally regulate muscle mass may be disrupted by deregulation of platelet derived growth factor receptor beta signaling and the PI3K/AKT pathways, along with prolonged activation of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha signaling. Similar changes were detected in DM1 skeletal muscle compared with unaffected controls.

However, the mechanisms governing the outcome of IL-6 on cancer progression remain to be clarified. Our study unraveled a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-AU021063 downstream of IL-6 signaling. We found that IL-6 induced the expression of lncRNA-AU021063 predominantly in breast cancer compared to other cancer types. Mechanistically, IL-6 induced AT-rich interactive domain 5a (Arid5a) expression, which promotes the transcription of lncRNA-AU021063. In turn, lncRNA-AU021063 promotes breast cancer metastasis through stabilizing tribbles homolog 3 (Trib3) and activating Mek/Erk signaling pathway. Genetic ablation of either Arid5a, lncRNA-AU021063 or Trib3 abolished breast cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our study highlights the importance of IL-6-Arid5a-lncRNA-AU021063 axis in regulating breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis, which may provide potential novel therapeutics for breast cancer.		murine breast cancer 4T1 cells;hAU021063-4T1 knockdown 4T1 cells;mock transfected 4T1 cells

Rationally sequencing and/or combining them may overcome innate and acquired resistance. We observed increased clinical benefit of BRAF andV600MUT/MEK inhibitors in patients with advanced BRAFV600MUT melanoma who were previously treated with immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). To test whether ICT primes MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) efficacy, we compared sequential/combinatorial regimens in subcutaneous mouse tumors driven by BrafV600, Nras, Nf1 or Kras mutations. The most efficacious regimen consisted of anti-PD-L1 lead-in preceding MAPKi combination and specifically promoted intratumoral pro-inflammatory macrophages and clonal expansion of IFNhi, CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (relative to CD4+ regulatory T-cells) that highly expressed activation and cytolytic genes. Since melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) and its propensity for therapeutic resistance limit patient survival, we developed an experimental metastasis model of BrafV600MUT MBM. Sequencing anti-PD-L1 before MAPKi combination resulted in superior MBM control and survival as well as robust intratumoral T-cell clonal expansion both intracranially and extracranially.

Here, we have studied the efficacy of cycles of a 4-5 day fasting mimicking diet (FMD) in inhibiting high-fat, high calorie diet (HFCD) -induced obesity in mature female C57BL/6 mice. We show that a monthly 5-day cycle of FMD inhibit HFCD-mediated obesity by causing a reduction in calorie intake and accumulation of visceral and subcutaneous fat depots without lean body mass loss. FMD cycles also increase cardiac vascularity, function and stress resistance, and reverse the hypercholesterolemia caused by the HFCD. The sustained activation of adipocyte genes associated with mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis and the sustained ketogenesis in the HFCD-fed mice subjected to monthly cycles of FMD indicate a reprogramming of fat cell metabolism that is likely to be at the center of obesity reversal. All these improvements could explain the protection from early mortality elicited by the high-fat, high calorie diet.

Methods: In this study, exoLRs profile of 10 AMI patients, 8 stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, and 10 healthy individuals were achieved by exosomes isolation and RNA sequencing. Bioinformatics approaches were used to investigate the features and potential clinical value of exoLRs. Results: Exosomal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) made up a majority of the total exoLRs. Immune cell types analyzed by CIBERSORT showed that neutrophils and monocytes were significantly enriched in the AMI group which were consistent with the clinical baseline characteristic. The biological processes enrichment analyses of different exosomal mRNAs and co-expression network analysis both indicated that neutrophils activation associated processes were enriched in the AMI group. We further identified two exosomal mRNA ALPL and CXCR2 which might be served as potential biomarkers for AMI diagnosis. Conclusions: Our study explored the alteration of exoLRs in the AMI patients which was associated with the acute inflammatory response mediated by neutrophils. Exosomal mRNAs ALPL and CXCR2 might be potentially useful for AMI diagnosis.		66 years old;52 years old;70 years old;46 years old;53 years old;17 years old;45 years old;51 years old;exosome from plasma;77 years old;57 years old;stable coronary artery disease;38 years old;63 years old;56 years old;58 years old;39 years old;73 years old;55 years old;35 years old;42 years old;acute myocardial infarction;54 years old;healthy individual

In this study we have described essential roles for the transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ, which are key effectors of Hippo pathway signaling, in maintaining lung epithelial homeostasis. Phenotypes associated with Yap/Taz deletion include alveolar defects and a striking development of goblet cell metaplasia throughout the airways. Knockdown of YAP and TAZ in HBECs similarly drives mucin expression. The TEAD family of transcription factors are well characterized partners of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional effectors, and we have found that knockdown of TEAD1-4 similarly drives elevated mucin expression. In order to further understand the role of the TEAD transcription factors in human lung epithelial cell fate, we conducted TEAD Chromatin Immunopreciptitation (ChIP)-Sequencing.

GSE156452	2021.08.19	Homo sapiens	GPL18573	TRUE	FALSE	12	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Identification of key regulatory pathways in response to long-term zinc supplementation in human primary retinal pigment epithelium: a multi-omics approach	Purpose: In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both systemic and local zinc concentrations are decreased. Elevating zinc levels by nutrition or oral supplementation has a positive impact on delaying the progression to end-stage AMD in clinical studies. Here we set out to identify key regulatory pathways involved in this beneficial effect in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Methods: Transcriptome profiles of 5 weeks old primary human fetal retinal pigment epithelial cells from 3 different donors were generated by RNA sequencing using Illumina NextSeq 5000. The samples from the 3 donors represent replicates of each conditions. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed further for differentially expressed genes (DEG) performing quasi-likelihood F-test in edgeR package (Robinson, McCarthy et al. 2010). Lowly expressed genes were filtered out using the following script was used: > keep <- rowSums(cpm(y)> 0.05) >= 1. To be considered as differentislly expressed gene, the Benjamini-Hochberg–adjusted P value was less than 0.05. Results: Using our data analysis workflow, we were able to identify over 32,000 transcripts. 826 of these were significantly changed in the three independent samples after apical and 218 after basal zinc supplementation when compared to untreated controls. Apical zinc supplementation upregulated 415 and down-regulated 411 transcripts. Basal zinc supplementation upregulated 157 and down-regulated 59 transcripts. 163 transcripts changed similarly after both apical and basal treatment.		donor #3;fetal eye;5 weeks;zinc apical treat;donor #1;primary retinal pigment epithelial cells;donor #2;control;zinc basal treat

How histone modifications contribute to this process remains unclear. Using global chromatin perturbations and local, time-controlled modulation of transcription, we establish the existence of epigenetic memory of transcriptional activation for genes that can be silenced by the Polycomb group. This property emerges during cell differentiation and allows genes to be stably switched following a transient transcriptional stimulus. This transcriptional memory state at Polycomb targets operates in cis; however, rather than relying solely on read-and-write propagation of histone modifications, the memory is also linked to the strength of activating input opposing Polycomb proteins and therefore varies with the cellular context. Our data and computational simulations suggest a model whereby transcriptional memory arises from double-negative feedback between Polycomb-mediated silencing and active transcription. Epigenetic memory at Polycomb targets thus depends not only on histone modifications but also on the gene-regulatory network and underlying identity of a cell.		wild-type + 2 uM UNC1999 + 4 uM A395;after transient induction;Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast line B;Ezh2 -/- (reversible);Heterokaryon of DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Foxa1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Foxa1-mutant, untreated;after washout of  2 uM UNC1999 + 4 uM A395;Mouse embryonic stem cells E14;DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Foxa1;Neural progenitor cells, wild-type after washout of  2 µM UNC1999 + 4 µM A395;nascent RNA;wild-type after washout of  2 uM UNC1999 + 4 uM A395;Mouse embryonic stem cells;after washout of 2 uM UNC1999 + 4 uM A395;+ 2 uM UNC1999 + 4 uM A395;Heterokaryon (of DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Foxa1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Foxa1-mutant, untreated), during transient induction;c-myc-immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts;DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Foxa1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Foxa1-mutant; sgRNA-Foxa1, after transient induction;Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast line A, wild-type;Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast line A, Ezh2 -/-;Ezh2 endogenous rescue;DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Nr2f1;ES-derived neural progenitor cells;total RNA;DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Nr2f1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Nr2f1-mutant; sgRNA-Nr2f1, after transient induction;Heterokaryon (of DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Foxa1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Foxa1-mutant, untreated), after transient induction;Neural progenitor cells, wild-type;untreated;Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast line B, wild-type;DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Foxa1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Foxa1-mutant, untreated;Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast line B, Ezh2 -/- (reversible);Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast line A, Ezh2 -/- , retroviral pMSCV-Ezh2;2 uM UNC1999 + 4 uM A395;uninduced;DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Nr2f1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Nr2f1-mutant, untreated;Heterokaryon of DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Nr2f1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Nr2f1-mutant, untreated;Neural progenitor cells, wild-type + 2 µM UNC1999 + 4 µM A395;Heterokaryon (of DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Nr2f1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Nr2f1-mutant, untreated), after transient induction;Heterokaryon (of DD-dCas9-VPR; sgRNA-Nr2f1, after transient induction and DD-dCas9-VPR; Nr2f1-mutant, untreated), during transient induction;Ezh2 -/-;wild-type;Ezh2 -/- , retroviral pMSCV-Ezh2;Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast line B, Ezh2 endogenous rescue

Global loss of DNA methylation and genomic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a hallmark of human cancers. Here, we used our recently developed single base resolution approaches, hmTOP-seq and uTOP-seq, for construction of 5hmC maps and identification of large hypomethylated domains (PMDs) in different NB cell subpopulations. The 5hmC profiles revealed distinct signatures characteristic of different cell lineages and stages of malignant transformation of NB cells in a conventional and oxygen depleted environment, which often occurs in tumours. The analysis of the cell type-specific PMD distribution highlighted differences in global genome organization among NB cells that were ascribed to the same lineage identity by transcriptome assays. Collectively, we demonstrated a high informativeness of the integrative epigenomic and transcriptomic research in relation to large scale genome structure in investigating the mechanisms that regulate cell identities and developmental stages of NB cells. Such multi-omics analysis, as compared to mutational studies, open new ways for identification of novel disease-associated features which bring prognostic and therapeutic value in treating this aggressive pediatric disease.

However, the accurate role of Versican in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains an enigma. Our current study reveals that VersicanV1, a predominant isoform of Versican in liver, is significantly unregulated in HCC tissues and correlates with poor prognosis. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that knockdown of VersicanV1 in HCC cells attenuates cancer cells malignancy. Further studies identify the positive role of VersicanV1 in aerobic glycolysis. Mechanistic investigation discovers the activation of EGFR-PI3K-AKT pathway in HCC cells expressing high VersicanV1. Moreover, EGF-like motif is indispensable for VersicanV1 to promote Warburg effect of HCC cells and subsequently, proliferation, invasion and metastasis ability via activation of EGFR-PI3K-AKT axis. Taken together, our research highlights a novel role of VersicanV1 in the progression of HCC, suggesting that VersicanV1 is an indicator for prognosis and a potential therapeutic target of HCC.

However, many gene signatures in orthotopic breast cancer metastasis have not yet been studied in detail. Here we have established new highly lung metastatic breast cancer cells from MDA-MB231 by OX model.Comparative analysis between Parent cells (MDA-MB231) and the highly lung metastatic breast cancer cells (LM05) revealed that Non-canonical NF-κB pathway was constitutively activated by NIK up-regulation in protein level. In addition, the NIK up-regulation was ascribed to a decrease in translation of cIAP1 which degrade NIK by ubiquitination. Next, we investigated the NIK function in LM05 and found the NIK up-regulation contributed to tumorigenicity. To further analyze NIK funcion of tumorigenicity, we conducted RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry staining of NIK Knockdown cells and control cells. As these results,the suppression tumorigenicity caused by NIK knockdown is attributed to the down-regulation of attraction of CAFs by decreased in some cytokines and chemokines expressions. Finally, we investigated the relationship between NIK protein levels and breast cancer malignancy. From this analysis, NIK expression in breast cancer revealed that normal breast tissue was hardly detectable NIK protein. On the other hand, the expression of NIK protein was increased in malignancy tumors. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that a new role and up-regulation mechanism for NIK in breast cancer progression.		Control;NIK knockdown;Human breast cancer cells

We tested the PFH by expressing the endodermal PF FoxA1 and nonPF Hnf4a in K562 lymphoblast cells. While co-expression of FoxA1 and Hnf4a activated a burst of endoderm-specific gene expression, we found no evidence for functional distinction between these two TFs. When expressed independently, both TFs bound and opened inaccessible sites, activated endodermal genes, and “pioneered” for each other, although FoxA1 required fewer copies of its motif to bind at inaccessible sites. A subset of targets required both TFs, but the mode of action at these targets did not conform to the sequential activity predicted by the PFH. From these results we propose an alternative to the PFH where “pioneer activity” depends not on the existence of discrete TF subclasses, but on TF binding affinity and genomic context.

Though treatments for GHPA have greatly improved, lack of deep knowledge on the precise molecular mechanisms involved in GHPA hinders the development of therapeutic approaches. Few studies have attempted to reveal the genome-wide landscape of GHPA. As chromatin structure change exerts significant influence on gene transcription, herein, we investigated the landscape of chromatin accessibility. Methods: Both assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were applied to identify the differential expression genes (DEGs) and uncover chromatin accessibility changes and the potentially associated transcription factor (TFs) in somatotropinoma tissues. Results: 64 DEGs were obtained, including 10 DEGs were elevated in the tumors and 54 DEGs were negligibly expressed in adenomas. A total of 3916 increased and 2895 decreased chromatin-accessible regions were identified nearby these DEGs. The majority of DEGs associated with closed chromatin regions were significantly down-regulated in our study, while the most of DEGs near open chromatin were not expectantly up-regulated. Additionally, the newly opened and closed chromatin regions were highly enriched for GRE and CTCF transcription factor binding sites, which were potentially relevant to the regulation of chromatin accessibility and genes expression in GHPA. Conclusion: Collectively, our results reveal the landscape of chromatin accessibility and unique enhancer in GHPA, which may, at least in part, contribute to tumorigenesis and provide a new field of drug development.		pituitary tumors;normal pituitary tissues

During obesity, macrophages accumulate in the visceral adipose tissue, creating a low grade inflammatory environment through the production of inflammatory cytokines. NF-κB signaling is a central coordinator of these inflammatory responses and is tightly regulated by the anti-inflammatory protein A20. To understand the role of inflammatory macrophages in insulin resistance and T2D development, we fed myeloid-specific A20 deficient mice (A20myel-KO mice) with a high fat diet, and demonstrate that these mice are completely protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, despite an inflammatory environment in their metabolic tissues. Macrophages lacking A20 show impaired mitochondrial respiratory function and metabolize more palmitate both in vitro and in vivo. Given the increased macrophage numbers in A20myel-KO mice, we hypothesize that A20 deficient macrophages rely more on palmitate oxidation and metabolize the fat present in the diet, resulting in a lean phenotype and protection from metabolic disease. These findings reveal an unexpected role for A20 in regulating macrophage immunometabolism.

In this study, we identified a subpopulation of microglia with disease-enhancing proinflammatory signatures associated with the R47H mutation in human AD brains and tauopathy mouse brains. Using transcriptomic analysis at the single-nuclei level from AD patients with the R47H or the common variant (CV)-TREM2 with matched sex, pathology and clinical dementia status, we found that the R47H mutation was associated with cell type- and sex-specific transcriptional changes in human AD brains. Further characterization of microglia revealed that R47H-associated microglial subpopulations had enhanced inflammatory signatures reminiscent of previously-identified disease-associated microglia (DAM) and hyperactivation of AKT, one of the signaling pathways downstream of TREM2. In a newly-generated tauopathy knock-in mouse model expressing one allele of human TREM2 (hTREM2) with either the R47H mutation or CV, R47H induced and exacerbated tau-mediated spatial memory deficits in female mice. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of microglia from these mice also revealed transcriptomic changes induced by R47H that had significant overlaps with R47H microglia in human AD brains, including robust increases in proinflammatory cytokines, activation of Akt-signaling, and elevation of a subset of disease-associated microglial signatures. Strikingly, pharmacological Akt inhibition largely reversed the enhanced inflammatory signatures induced by R47H in primary microglia treated with tau fibrils as well as rescued the tauopathy-induced synapse loss in R47H heterozygous mice. By unraveling the disease-enhancing properties of the R47H mutation in mouse and human, our findings shed light on an immune-linked AD subtype and provide new directions for modulating microglial immune responses to treat AD.		mTrem2 +/+;hTrem2 R47H/+;1 ug/ml 0N4R tau;1 uM MK2206;Bulk RNA-Seq;Primary microglia

HIV infection impairs gut homeostasis and is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 fatality. To investigate the potential link between these observations, we analyzed single-cell transcriptional profiles and SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor expression across lymphoid and mucosal human tissue from chronically HIV-infected individuals and uninfected controls. Absorptive gut enterocytes displayed the highest coexpression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4, of which ACE2 expression was associated with canonical interferon response and antiviral genes. Chronic treated HIV infection was associated with a clear antiviral response in gut enterocytes and, unexpectedly, with a substantial reduction of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 target cells. Gut tissue from SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals, however, showed abundant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in both the large and small intestine, including an HIV-coinfected individual. Thus, upregulation of antiviral response genes and downregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the GI tract of HIV-infected individuals does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this compartment.

Manifestations of GVHD in the central nervous system (CNS) present as neurocognitive dysfunction in up to 60% of patients, however, the mechanisms driving chronic GVHD in the CNS are yet to be elucidated. Our studies of murine chronic GVHD revealed a spatial learning and memory deficit associated with inflammation in the hippocampus underlain by persistent Ifng upregulation. By flow cytometry, we observed a proportional shift in the donor-derived T-cell population in the chronic GVHD brain from early CD8 dominance to later CD4 sequestration. Hippocampal RNA sequencing identified perturbations to structural and functional synapse-related gene expression, together with the upregulation of genes associated with IFN-γ responses and antigen presentation. Neuroinflammation in the cortex of mice and humans during acute GVHD was recently shown to be mediated by resident microglia-derived TNF. In contrast, infiltration of pro-inflammatory MHC class II+ donor bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was identified as a distinguishing feature of CNS chronic GVHD. Donor BMDM, which comprised up to 50% of the CNS myeloid population, exhibited a transcriptional signature distinct from resident microglia. Recipients of MHC class II knockout bone marrow grafts exhibited attenuated neuroinflammation, suggestive of a critical role for donor BMDM in chronic CNS GVHD. Our identification of disease mediators distinct from those in the acute phase indicates the necessity to pursue alternative therapeutic targets for late-stage neurological manifestations.

A few studies have determined long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. However, the roles of lncRNAs in ALD development is still poorly understood. Methods: An ALD mouse model was established and confirmed. Expression profiles of lncRNAs were obtained by whole transcriptome sequencing. The altered lncRNAs in ALD mice were further verified by qRT-PCR. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were used to enrich the functions of these lncRNAs. In combination with miRNA and mRNA profiles, we constructed concise endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. The function of the most up/downregulated lnRNA signaling was further verified and investigated in both ALD model and AML-12 cells. Results: Totally, five downregulated lncRNAs were obtained and verified in ALD mice. The GO term and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that the identified lncRNAs were associated with alcohol-induced hepatic oxidative damage, cellular inflammation, and lipid metabolism. Integration the differentially modulated miRNAs and mRNAs with ceRNA network analysis, we constructed five ceRNA networks and screened out 30 miRNAs and 25 mRNAs that may participate in ALD. Further, we verified and investigate the function of the most downregulated lnc_1700023H06Rik. Depletion lnc_1700023H06Rik reduced genes related to lipid metabolism, especially mRNA Acat2 (ENSMUST00000159697) and Pgrmc2 (ENSMUST00000058578) in both ALD mice and AML12 cell. Knocking down lnc_1700023H06Rik induced triglyceride accumulation and LDH leakage in AML12 cells, consisting with that in alcohol-treated cells, confirming the potential pathological role of lnc_1700023H06Rik in ALD. Conclusion: The five remarkably downregulated lncRNAs in an ALD mouse model were identified as novel biomarkers, highlighting the key role of lncRNAs in the development of ALD. The effect of lnc_1700023H06Rik was further verified.

However, the pathogenesis of bone metastases has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by gene expression microarray analysis of NSCLC tissue samples with or without bone metastases. Subsequently, collagen family collagen 6A1 (COL6A1) was chosen as the target gene through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR validation of the top eight DEGs. COL6A1 was overexpressed or knocked down, and the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation and Transwell invasion assays. Additionally, the osteogenic capacity of HOB and hES-MP 002.5 cells was assessed using RT-qPCR, western blotting, Alizarin Red staining and alkaline phosphatase staining. A total of 364 DEGs were identified in NSCLC tissues with bone metastases compared with NSCLC tissues without bone metastases, including 140 upregulated genes and 224 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the upregulated and downregulated genes were primarily enriched in ‘cellular process’, ‘metabolic process’ and ‘biological regulation’. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were primarily enriched in ‘cysteine and methionine metabolism’, ‘oxidative phosphorylation’ and the ‘ribosome’, while the downregulated genes were primarily enriched in ‘transcriptional mis-regulation in cancer’, ‘ribosome’ and ‘mitophagy in animals’. COL6A1 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissue samples with bone metastases. Functionally, COL6A1 overexpression induced the proliferation and invasion of HARA cells, and knockdown prevented the proliferation and invasion of HARA-B4 cells. Finally, it was demonstrated that HOB and hES-MP 002.5 cells exhibited osteogenic capacity, and overexpression of COL6A1 in HARA cells increased adhesion of these cells to the osteoblasts, whereas knockdown of COL6A1 in HARA-B4 cells reduced their adhesive ability. In conclusion, COL6A1 may serve as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for bone metastasis in NSCLC.

Methods: 5- to 7-week-old C57BL/6J (‘B’) and CAST/EiJ (‘C’) females (the F0 generation) were exposed through their drinking water to 0 ppm or 50 ppm Cd in the form of CdCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 202908) for a period of 5 weeks, then mated with a male of the opposite strain. Cd exposure continued throughout pregnancy and was discontinued at litter birth. A hybrid mating scheme (the F1 generation) was employed to enable analyses of allele-specific gene expression and DNA methylation for a separate study (Hudson & Cowley, manuscript in preparation). The genotypes of F1 mice are referred to as ‘BxC’ (B mother x C father). F1 animals were sacrificed and dissected within 24 hours of birth; sample sizes can be found in supplementary tables associated with the publication. F1 mice were dissected within 24 hours of birth. All animal work was approved by the North Carolina State University (NCSU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, under protocol 16-045-B. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principles in the Use of Animals in Toxicology. Frozen whole brains obtained from four 0 ppm and four 50 ppm newborn female BxC pups representing four litters per exposure group were pulverized using a hammer and liquid nitrogen. 7-10 mg of tissue was then used to extract DNA and RNA simultaneously using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA kit (Qiagen, 80204). RNA was extracted using the recommended protocol for fatty tissues. RNA and DNA were quantified using a Nanodrop 2000. RNA purity and size integrity were determined at the NCSU Genomic Sciences Laboratory (GSL) using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies). Results: We identified 15 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that aligned to both the B and C genomes. Conclusions: These 15 DEGs (and subsequent confirmatory qRT-PCRs on the 8 samples sequenced here plus an additional Cd dose and samples) suggest altered onset of myelination throughout the whole brain, as well as aberrant Hox gene expression due to maternal Cd exposure.

ASNS copy number amplification is associated with a significantly decreased survival. Using patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs), we showed significant metabolic alterations occur in gliomas when perturbing the expression of asparagine synthetase, which is not merely restricted to amino acid homeostasis. ASNS-high GSCs maintained a slower basal metabolic profile yet readily shifted to a greatly increased capacity for glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation when needed. This led ASNS-high cells to a greater ability to proliferate and spread into brain tissue. Finally, we demonstrate that these changes confer resistance to cellular stress, notably oxidative stress, through adaptive redox homeostasis which led to radiation resistance. Furthermore, ASNS overexpression led to modifications of the one-carbon metabolism to promote a more antioxidant tumor environment revealing a metabolic vulnerability that may be therapeutically exploited.

Previously we demonstrated that Ahnak mediated transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during tumor metastasis. It is well-known that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) invade the vasculature of adjacent target tissues before working to adapt to the host environments. Currently, the molecular mechanism by which infiltrated tumor cells interact with host cells to survive within target tissue environments is far from clear. Here, we show that Ahnak regulates tumor metastasis through PCSK9 expression. To validate the molecular function of Ahnak in metastasis, wild-type (WT) B16F10 melanoma cells were injected into WT and Ahnak knockout (Ahnak-/-) mice. Ahnak-/- mice were more resistant to the pulmonary metastasis of B16F10 cells compared to WT mice. To investigate the host function of Ahnak in recipient organs against metastasis of melanoma cells, transcriptomic analyses of primary pulmonary endothelial cells from WT or Ahnak-/- mice in the absence or presence of TGFβ stimulation were performed. We found PCSK9, along with several other candidate genes, was involved in the invasion of melanoma cells into lung tissues. PCSK9 expression in the pulmonary artery was higher in WT mice than Ahnak-/- mice. To evaluate the host function of PCSK9 in lung tissues during the metastasis of melanoma cells, we established lung epithelial cell-specific tamoxifen-induced PCSK9 conditional KO mice (Scgb1-Cre/PCSK9fl/fl). The pulmonary metastasis of B16F10 cells in Scgb1-Cre/PCSK9fl/fl mice was significantly suppressed, indicating that PCSK9 plays an important role in the metastasis of melanoma cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Ahnak regulates metastatic colonization through the regulation of PCSK9 expression.		6 to 8-wk-old mice;primary pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs);control B16F10 cells;Ahnak-knockdown B16F10 stable cells;Ahnak knockout (Ahnak-/-) mice;WT mice;none;TGFβ stimulation

Although responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, the mechanisms underlying HAV-mediated liver injury are poorly understood. Ifnar1-/- mice are susceptible to HAV and when infected recapitulate cardinal features of hepatitis A in humans, including serum ALT elevation, hepatocellular apoptosis, and intrahepatic inflammatory cell infiltrates. In contrast, Mavs-/- mice, while equally permissive for infection, experience no liver injury. Previous studies indicate that HAV pathogenesis in Ifnar1-/- mice is dependent upon MAVS-IRF3 signaling, but leave unresolved the role of IRF3-mediated transcription versus non-transcriptional pro-apoptotic activity of activated IRF3 in HAV-induced liver disease.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) recruited by tumour cells in TME support tumour development. However, the influence of stroma on MDSC is unclear. Here we aimed to unveil the roles of stroma in the recruitment of MDSC in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We created xenograft OSCC models on GFP+ bone marrow transplanted nude mice. We co-xenografted human OSCC cells line (HSC-2) with three different types of stromal cells, including human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) or patient-derived stromal cells (PDS1 and PDS2) isolated from two OSCC patients, or without stromal cells. Tumour/stroma co-xenograft models recruited significantly higher numbers of GFP+ bone marrow (BM) cells than the tumour cells alone xenografted group. However, only patient-derived stroma xenograft (PDSX) models promoted GR1/CD11b/Arg1 triple-positive MDSC, which was the main population influenced by stromal character and depended on the stroma secreted CCL2. In vitro inhibition of CCL2 synthesis in PDS cocultures also resulted in significantly decreased migration of BM cells than in HDF coculture and HSC-2 alone culture. Moreover, CCR2+ MDSC infiltrated considerably higher in PDSX models. Taken together, we demonstrated that stromal cells are responsible for MDSC recruitment and stroma secreted CCL2 play an essential role in MDSC recruitment in OSCC.

The five-year survival rate remains less than 50% for high-risk neuroblastoma patients, few of them show effective response to current chemotherapy drugs. It is urgent to identify new therapeutic targets and corresponding drugs for high-risk neuroblastoma. Exportin-1(XPO1), also known as chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1), plays important roles in the progress of tumorigenesis. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of XPO1 in neuroblastoma have not been reported. Here, our results showed that overexpression of XPO1 was significantly associated with poor clinical characteristics and prognosis of neuroblastoma patients. The specific inhibitor of XPO1 suppressed neuroblastoma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, inhibition of XPO1 suppressed neuroblastoma cells proliferation and induced cell apoptosis by FOXO1 and RB1 nuclear accumulation in neuroblastoma through inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway, and induced G0/G1 phase cell arrest by activating P53 function. Together, XPO1 is a promising prognostic indicator for neuroblastoma and a novel target for antitumor treatment by selective inhibitor verdinexor (KPT-335).		DMSO;neuroblastoma;SK-N-BE(2);KPT-335

While hyperglycemia is known to cause microRNA dysregulation that contributes to cellular activation, whether it can do so through intercellular communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs) is not known. We investigated whether EVs produced under hyperglycemic conditions could communicate signaling to drive atherosclerosis. We did so by treating Apoe−/−mice with exosomes produced by bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDM) exposed to high glucose (BMDM–HG-exo) or control. Repeated infusion of BMDM–HG-exo led to a robust increase in hematopoiesis leading to augmented circulating myeloid cell numbers. Four weeks of BMDM–HG-exo infusions increased atherosclerotic lesion sizes with an accumulation of macrophage and apoptotic cells in the aortic root. Transcriptome-wide analysis of naïve cultured macrophages treated with BMDM–HG-exo showed an upregulation of genes associated with cell proliferation. Furthermore, BMDM–HG-exo reprogramed energy metabolism in recipient macrophages with an upregulation of glycolytic activity. Plasma EVs isolated from human subjects with type II diabetes exerted similar cell signaling when incubated with cultured human macrophages. Lastly, profiling microRNA in BMDM–HG-exo and human diabetic plasma EVs converged on miR-486 as commonly enriched.

Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) is accompanied by the clonal evolution of myeloma with heterogeneous genomic aberrations and profound changes of the bone marrow microenvironment (BME). However, the molecular mechanisms that drive drug resistance remain elusive. Here, we have analyzed the heterogeneous tumor cell population of 20 RRMM patients and its complex interaction network with the BME by single cell RNA-sequencing before/after treatment. Subclones with chromosome 1q-gain expressed a specific transcriptomic signature and frequently expanded during treatment. Furthermore, RRMM cells shaped an immune suppressive BME by upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and close interaction with the myeloid compartment. It was characterized by the accumulation of PD1+ γδ T-cells and tumor-associated macrophages as well as the depletion of hematopoietic progenitors. Thus, our study resolves transcriptional features of subclones in RRMM and mechanisms of microenvironmental reprogramming with implications for clinical decision-making.

There are four types of congenital generalized lipodystrophy based on the causative genetic alterations. The symptoms and the degrees of disease progression are varied among all affected individuals, which might be due to unknown genetic modifiers. To identify potential predictive biomarkers associated with the disease progressions, we recruited 7 patients (cgl2_p1,cgl2_p2,cgl2_p3,cgl2_p4,cgl2_p5,cgl2_p6,cgl2_p7),as well as gender/aged-matched controls (cgl2_c1,cgl2_c2,cgl2_c3,cgl2_c4,cgl2_c5,cgl2_c6,cgl2_c7).The total RNA samples were extracted from the participants' peripheral blood mononuclear cells, followed by RNA-Seq. To find the molecular signatures that might be associated with disease progression, patients were further categorized into sub-groups based on the results of biochemical analysis and their clinical symptoms (e.g. diabetes, metabolic syndrome and metal retardation). DEGs were identified for each sub-groups of patients, and pathway analysis was performed to explore the underlying dysregulated mechanisms.		5 years 7 months;17 years 10 months;3 years 11 months;severe intellectual disability;16 years 4 months;6 years 1 months;hyperlipidemia, Diabetes mellitus, severe intellectual disability;PBMC;4 years 6 months;13 years 8 months;6 years 5 months;19 years 2 months;17 years 6 months;15 years 9 months;hyperlipidemia, intellectual disability;19 years 5 months;Diabetes mellitus, intellectual disability;congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 2;hyperlipidemia,Diabetes mellitus,  intellectual disability

An aberrant recapitulation of lung developmental genes including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and WNT has been widely implicated in the abnormal wound healing process following repetitive alveolar epithelial injury during IPF pathogenesis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes and microvesicles have been shown to carry various bioactive molecules and are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate that human bronchial epithelial cell-derived EVs (HBEC EVs) inhibited TGF-β-induced both myofibroblast differentiation and lung epithelial cellular senescence through attenuating WNT signaling.

How the HSC compartment maintains its long-term fitness in condition of chronic stresses associated with systemic metabolic disorders is poorly understood. In this study, we show that obesity functionally affects the long-term function of the most immature engrafting HSC subpopulation. We link this altered regenerative activity to the oxidative stress and the aberrant constitutive activation of the AKT signaling pathway that characterized the obese environment. In contrast, we found minor disruptions of the HSC function in obese mice at steady state, suggesting that active mechanisms could protect the HSC compartment from its disturbed environment. Consistent with this idea, we found that FOXO proteins in HSCs isolated from obese mice become insensitive to their normal upstream regulators such as AKT, even during intense oxidative stress. We established that hyperglycemia, a key condition associated with obesity, is directly responsible for the alteration of the AKT-FOXO axis in HSCs and their abnormal oxidative stress response. As a consequence, we observed that HSCs isolated from a hyperglycemic environment display enhanced resistance to oxidative stress and DNA damage. Altogether, these results indicate that chronic metabolic stresses associated with obesity and/or hyperglycemia affect the wiring of the HSCs and modify their oxidative stress response. These data suggest that the uncoupling of FOXO to its environmental regulators could be a key adaptive strategy that promotes the survival of the HSC compartment in obesity.

Then we evaluated treatment feasibility, safety and clinical response. To further investigate the relationship between the tumor microenvironment and the patient's clinical course, we performed gene expression analysis of the pre-treatment tumor cells and immunohistochemistry of the tumor tissue focusing on delineating the immune components and immunologic milieu within the tumor. Together with the results of genomic and immunological analysis of ex vivo cultured TILs by flowcytometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we considered the various immunostimulating or immunosupprrsive factors giving influence on the effects of the conducted TIL-ACT.

Here, we develop an approach for the generation of synthetic RNA library resembling the endogenous transcriptome but lacking modifications.

In this study we describe two opposing roles for immunoproteasomes in regulating the tumor microenvironment. During chronic inflammation, immunoproteasomes modulated the expression of pro-tumorigenic cytokines and chemokines and enhanced infiltration of innate immune cells that led to the onset of colitis-associated carcinogenesies (CAC). In ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with high risk for CAC, immunoproteasome-induced pro-tumorigenic mediators were highly upregulated. Interestingly, the role for the same enzymatic complex in melanoma tumors is relatively unknown. We found that the high expression of immunoproteasomes in human melanoma was associated with better prognosis. Our data revealed that the immunoproteasome has a strong anti-tumorigenic function in cancer types with non-inflammatory microenvironment such as melanoma. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from immunoproteasome-deficient mice were reduced during T cell homeostasis and were not able to combat melanoma efficiently. Our results indicate that the immunoproteasome exhibits either pro- or anti-tumoral properties in a context-dependent manner.		gut control;gut UC;gut;healthy control;Ulcerative colitis

Here, we describe the physiological function of the Cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2 (Creld2), which has been previously characterized as a downstream target of the ER-stress signal transducer Atf6. Creld2 enhances protein folding and degradation through its interaction with proteins involved in UPR, thereby, promoting tolerance of chronic stress and recovery from acute stress. Using a genetic knockout model, we show that Creld2-deficiency leads to a dysregulated UPR, and causes the development of hepatic steatosis in male mice, while females are protected. We observed this sex dimorphism also in humans with fatty liver disease, with only males showing an accumulation of CRELD2 protein in the liver. These results reveal a Creld2 function at the intersection between UPR and metabolic homeostasis and suggest a mechanism in which chronic ER stress underlies fatty liver disease in males.

PCa is clinically unpredictable; while most tumors are indolent, others exhibit lethal phenotypes. Current treatments of metastatic disease are not curative and lead to acquired resistance and relapse. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are thought to be associated with PCa relapse and represent a target against metastatic PCa. We isolated CSCs from metastatic PCa PC3 cells based on their ability to form spheres. We determined that TIP5, a factor previously implicated in aggressive PCa, is required for the formation of PCa spheres. We determined that TIP5-bromodomain (TIP5-BRD) is an epigenetic reader of H3K14ac. TIP5 genomic occupancy in PCa cells correlates with H3K14ac. We showed that a functional TIP5-BRD is required for the transition of PCa cells from a differentiated to a stem state. Mutations of TIP5-BRD or treatment with chemical probes that abrogate TIP5-BRD association with H3K14ac impair the formation of PCa spheres. Furthermore, treatment with TIP5-BRD inhibitors impairs the oncogenic transformation mediated by Pten-loss in PCa model organoids. Genome-wide occupancy analysis shows that TIP5 interacts with promoters of repressed genes in both PCa cells and metastatic tumors and with inactive enhancers that contain H3K14ac and are associated with genes implicated in developmental processes. Our findings indicate a role of TIP5 in PCa stem cell features and suggest potential epigenetic-reader therapeutic strategies to target TIP5 in aggressive PCa.		--;HA-tag (Abcam ab9110);none (input);siRNA-CTL;H3K27ac (Abcam ab4729);Pca progenitor - Cancer stem cells;H3K4me3 (Millipore 07-473);H3K27me3 (Active Motif 39155);RNAseq;Prostate cancer progenitors/CSC;ChIPseq;Metastatic;siRNA-TIP5;H3K14ac (Active Motif 61433);PC3 cells;Prostate

We investigated possible tolerance mechanisms preventing neuronal loss and disruption in gut motility after pathogen exposure. We found that following enteric infections, muscularis macrophages (MMs) acquire a tissue-protective phenotype that prevents neuronal loss and dysmotility during subsequent challenge with unrelated pathogens. Bacteria-induced neuroprotection relied on activation of gut-projecting sympathetic neurons and signaling via b2-adrenergic receptors (b2AR) on MMs. In contrast, helminth-mediated neuroprotection was dependent on T cells and systemic production of interleukin (IL)-4 and -13 by eosinophils, which induced arginase-expressing MMs that prevented neuronal loss from an unrelated infection located in a different intestinal region. Collectively, these data suggest that distinct enteric pathogens trigger a state of disease- or tissue tolerance that preserves ENS number and functionality.

The stability and transdermal penetration of THDC, however, may be compromised by the oxidant-rich environment of human skin. In this study, we show that THDC is a poor antioxidant that degrades rapidly when exposed to singlet oxygen. This degrada-tion, however, was prevented by combination with acetyl zingerone (AZ) as a stabilizing antiox-idant. As a standalone ingredient, THDC led to unexpected activation of type I interferon signaling, but this pro-inflammatory effect was blunted in the presence of AZ. Moreover, the combination of THDC and AZ increased expression of genes associated with phospholipid homeostasis and keratinocyte differentiation, along with repression of MMP1 and MMP7 expression, inhibition of MMP enzyme activity, and increased production of collagen proteins by dermal fibroblasts. Lastly, whereas THDC alone reduced viability of keratinocytes exposed to oxidative stress, this effect was completely abrogated by the addition of AZ to THDC. These results show that AZ is an effective antioxidant stabilizer of THDC and that combination of these products may improve ascorbic acid delivery. This provides a step towards reaching the full potential of ascorbate as an active ingredient in topical preparations.

Targeting the OC epigenome with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) or histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) increases immune signaling and recruits CD8+ T cells and NK cells to fight OC in murine models. This increased immune activity is caused by increased transcription of repetitive elements (RE) that form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and trigger an interferon response. To understand which REs are affected by epigenetic therapies in OC, we assessed the effect of DNMTi and HDACi on OC cell lines and patient samples. Subfamily-level (TEtranscripts) and individual locus-level (Telescope) analysis of REs showed that DNMTi treatment upregulated more REs than HDACi treatment. Upregulated REs were predominantly LTR and SINE subfamilies, and SINEs exhibited the greatest loss of DNA methylation upon DNMTi treatment. Cell lines with TP53 mutations exhibited significantly fewer upregulated REs with epigenetic therapy than wild type TP53 cell lines. This observation was validated using isogenic cell lines; the TP53 mutant cell line had significantly higher baseline expression of REs but upregulated fewer upon epigenetic treatment. In addition, p53 activation increased expression of REs in wild type but not mutant cell lines. These data give a comprehensive, genome-wide picture of RE chromatin and transcription-related changes in OC after epigenetic treatment and implicate p53 in RE transcriptional regulation. The data in this data series represent the analysis of triplicate RNAseq libraries generated from the TykNu ovarian carcinoma cell line treated with ITF-2357 (HDACi), 5-azacytidine (DNMTi), or a combination of both.

Disruption of circadian rhythms contributes to Type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathogenesis. We elucidated whether altered circadian rhythmicity of clock genes is associated with metabolic dysfunction in T2D. Transcriptional cycling of core clock genes BMAL1, CLOCK, and PER3 was altered in skeletal muscle from individuals with T2D and this was coupled with reduced number and amplitude of cycling genes and disturbed circadian oxygen consumption. Inner-mitochondria associated genes were enriched for rhythmic peaks in NGT, but not T2D, and positively correlated with insulin sensitivity. ChIP-sequencing identified CLOCK and BMAL1 binding to inner-mitochondrial genes associated with insulin sensitivity, implicating regulation by the core clock. Inner-mitochondria disruption altered core-clock gene expression and free-radical production, phenomena that were restored by resveratrol treatment. We identify bi-directional communication between mitochondrial function and rhythmic gene expression, processes which are disturbed in diabetes.		10.8675545689974;51.7943026267111;IRS1;25.29;10.5653172158553;13.3665852311801;24.53;23.86;16.1857195708472;33.57;33.6662967073622;33.6200517943026;28.95;26.73;12.7173510913799;32.76;25.39;26.09;26.89;24.9722530521643;26.03;35.377358490566;Biopsy from m. vastus lateralis;28.27;9.75767665556789;7.76914539400666;61.968183499815;10.809814341175;22.1975582685905;46.9385867554569;36.9034406215316;25.86;17.1106178320385;26.53;23.64;43.4517203107658;26.57;27.28;25.8;22.4287828338883;17.8;31.85;25.18;9.26748057713652;23.74;45.0887902330744;25.12;23.78;24.47;28.83;30.7991120976693;21.9663337032926;2.77469478357381;28.8;15.4920458749538;20.1165371809101;3.69959304476508;13.5035146133925;29.4580096189419;25.63;27.4694783573807;14.0954495005549;24.92;28.51;14.861139725728;27.2844987051424;2.08102108768036;8.32408435072142;T2D;29.35;17.5730669626341;27.11;25.79;26.46;42.3140954495006;16.416944136145;NGT;76.1259170747944;26.41;25.73;39.3081761006289;35.1461339252682;26.11;25.46;32.24;24.71;26.96;6.93673695893452;24.047354790973;24.08;30.71;27.78;27.76;27.77;CLA;27.71;31.465038845727;29.99

Targeting the OC epigenome with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) or histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) increases immune signaling and recruits CD8+ T cells and NK cells to fight OC in murine models. This increased immune activity is caused by increased transcription of repetitive elements (RE) that form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and trigger an interferon response. To understand which REs are affected by epigenetic therapies in OC, we assessed the effect of DNMTi and HDACi on OC cell lines and patient samples. Subfamily-level (TEtranscripts) and individual locus-level (Telescope) analysis of REs showed that DNMTi treatment upregulated more REs than HDACi treatment. Upregulated REs were predominantly LTR and SINE subfamilies, and SINEs exhibited the greatest loss of DNA methylation upon DNMTi treatment. Cell lines with TP53 mutations exhibited significantly fewer upregulated REs with epigenetic therapy than wild type TP53 cell lines. This observation was validated using isogenic cell lines; the TP53 mutant cell line had significantly higher baseline expression of REs but upregulated fewer upon epigenetic treatment. In addition, p53 activation increased expression of REs in wild type but not mutant cell lines. These data give a comprehensive, genome-wide picture of RE chromatin and transcription-related changes in OC after epigenetic treatment and implicate p53 in RE transcriptional regulation. The data in this data series represent the analysis of RNAseq libraries generated from the A2780, Hey, Kuramochi, and TykNu ovarian carcinoma cell lines.

GSE181885	2021.08.17	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	8	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis of Uterine Gene Expression in Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (Ezh2) Conditional Knockout Mice	Histone proteins undergo various modifications that alter chromatin structure, including addition of methyl groups. Enhancer of homolog 2 (EZH2), is a histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine residue 27, and thereby, suppresses gene expression. EZH2 plays integral role in the uterus and other reproductive organs. We have previously shown that conditional deletion of uterine EZH2 results in increased proliferation of luminal and glandular epithelial cells, and RNAseq analyses reveal several uterine transcriptomic changes in Ezh2 conditional (c) knockout (KO) mice that can affect estrogen signaling pathways. To pinpoint the origin of such gene expression changes, we used the recently developed spatial transcriptomics (ST) method with the hypotheses that Ezh2cKO mice would predominantly demonstrate changes in epithelial cells and/or ablation of this gene would disrupt normal epithelial/stromal gene expression patterns. Uteri were collected from ovariectomized adult WT and Ezh2cKO mice and analyzed by ST. Asb4, Cxcl14, Dio2, and Igfbp5 were increased, Sult1d1, Mt3, and Lcn2 were reduced in Ezh2cKO uterine epithelium vs. WT epithelium. For Ezh2cKO uterine stroma, differentially expressed key hub genes included Cald1, Fbln1, Myh11, Acta2, and Tagln. Conditional loss of uterine Ezh2 also appears to shift the balance of gene expression profiles in epithelial vs. stromal tissue toward uterine epithelial cell and gland development and proliferation, consistent with uterine gland hyperplasia in these mice. Current findings provide further insight into how EZH2 may selectively affect uterine epithelial and stromal compartments. Additionally, these transcriptome data might provide the mechanistic understanding and valuable biomarkers for human endometrial disorders with epigenetic underpinnings.

In this study, we characterized MORF4L1/MRG15 interactome. Using Flag-ChIP-sequencin K562 cells, we first claimed that both MRG15 isoforms (long or short chromodomain) and MORF4L2/MRGX which does not contain any chromodomain, shared mostly the same targets. Then, we described a new factor associated to MRG15, called EP400NL. EP400NL binds to BRD8 also linked to MRGBP and MRG15/X to form a new complex homolog to the yeast TINTIN. Using RNA-sequencing in BRD8 or MRGBP or MRG15/MRGX and KAT5/TIP60-depleted U2OS cells, we observed that human TINTIN plays a role in gene expression regulation independently of NuA4/TIP60 complex.		n/a;K562 from ATCC;K562;FLAG M2 , Mouse monoclonal, Sigma-Aldrich ,Cat# F1804, RRID:AB_262044;U2OS;siTIP60, smartpool (Dharmacon);Insertion of Tag only at the AAVS1 locus by Zinc finger Nuclease, puromycin selection;U2OS from ATCC;siBRD8, Sigma (SASI_Hs01_00131635);normal growth conditions;epithelial cells from osteosarcoma;siMRGBP, smartpool (Dharmacon);IgG, Rabbit polyclonal, Millipore, Cat# PP64, RRID:AB_97852;siMRGX, smartpool (Dharmacon);siLuciferase, DOYYA;siMRG15, smartpool (Dharmacon);lymphoblast from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)

Here, we aimed to model this transition in order to define underlying biological mechanisms and identify potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is neuroendocrine in origin and, in contrast to non-SCLC (NSCLC), rarely contains mutations that drive the MAPK pathway. Likewise, NSCLCs that transform to SCLC concomitantly with development of therapy resistance downregulate MAPK signaling, suggesting an inverse relationship between pathway activation and lineage state. To test this, we activated MAPK in SCLC through conditional expression of mutant KRAS or EGFR, which revealed suppression of the neuroendocrine differentiation program via ERK. We found that ERK induces the expression of ETS factors, phenocopying ERK-mediated effects on transformation into the NSCLC-like phenotype. ATAC-seq demonstrated ERK-driven changes in chromatin accessibility at putative regulatory regions and global chromatin rewiring at neuroendocrine and ETS transcriptional targets. Further, induction of ETS factors as well as suppression of neuroendocrine differentiation were dependent on histone acetyltransferase activities of CBP/p300. Overall, we describe how the ERK-CBP/p300-ETS axis promotes a lineage shift between neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine lung cancer phenotypes and provide rationale for the disruption of this program during transformation-driven resistance to targeted therapy.

Methods: Total RNA from each sample was used to prepare the library. Then the libraries were sequenced at 50bp single read on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Sequencing reads from each sample were mapped to the mouse reference genomes mm10 by using TopHat v2.1.1. The mapped reads were further analyzed by cufflinks v1.3.0 and the expression levels for each transcript were quantified as Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM). For differential expression analysis, sequencing counts at the gene level were obtained using HTSeq v 0.9.1. R package DESeq2 was then used to identify differential expressed genes between different conditions. Results: Transcriptome profiling reveals that ablation of β-catenin in MGE cells leads to advanced neuronal differentiation, while activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling keeps the MGE cells in an undifferentiated progenitor state. Conclusions: Wnt signaling is a key player in governing self-renewal vs. terminal differentiation of MGE progenitors both in vivo and in vitro.

We report that bintrafusp alfa (BA), a bifunctional fusion protein that simultaneously inhibits TGF-β and PD-L1, is a favorable combination partner for RT in eradicating multiple treatment-resistant tumor models. Beneficial effects of BA+RT (BART) are partly attributed to counterbalancing undesired RT effects and local tumor microenvironment reprograming, leading to reconstitution of tumor immunity and regression of spontaneous lung metastases. Intriguingly, BA, but neither TGF-β trap nor anti–PD-L1 alone, attenuates late-stage RT-induced lung fibrosis. Single cell transcriptome show TGF-β expression is confined to PD-L1+ endothelium and M2/lipofibroblast-like cells. Hence, superior effects of BA could be attributed to its ability to trap TGF-β to relevant PD-L1+ compartments. Here, we provide rationales that BART resensitizes tumors and broadens the therapeutic window.		orthotopic tumor;4T1;radiation;M7824;Female;M7824+radiation;control;6-12 weeks;BALB/c

However, the mechanisms of liver injury development are not clear in IBD patients. Gut microbiota is thought to be engaged in IBD pathogenesis. Here, by an integrated analysis of host transcriptome and colonic microbiome, we have attempted to reveal the mechanism of liver injury in colitis mice. In this study, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced mice colitis model was constructed. Liver and colon transcriptome results showed that immune response and lipid metabolism-related pathways were dramatically altered, while DNA damage repair-related pathways were only significantly down-regulated in the colon. The microbiota of DSS-treated mice underwent strong transitions. Correlation analyses identified genes associated with liver and colon injury, whose expression was associated with the abundance of liver and gut health-related bacteria Collectively, the results indicate that the liver injury in colitis mice may be related to the intestinal dysbiosis and host-microbiota interactions. These findings may provide new insights for identifying potential targets for the treatment of IBD and its induced liver injury.		liver;DSS;colon;post natal day 42;control;C57BL/6

Here we report that PARP1 is an intrinsic driver for oligodendroglial development and myelination. Genetic PARP1 depletion impairs the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes and impedes CNS myelination. Mechanistically, PARP1-mediated PARylation activity is not only necessary but also sufficient for OPC differentiation. At the molecular level, we identify the RNA-binding protein Myef2 as a PARylated target which controls OPC differentiation through PARylation-modulated de-repression of myelin protein expression. Furthermore, PARP1’s enzymatic activity is necessary for oligodendrocyte and myelin regeneration after demyelination. Together, our findings suggest that PARP1-mediated PARylation activity may be a potential therapeutic target for promoting OPC differentiation and remyelination in neurological disorders characterized by arrested OPC differentiation and remyelination failure such as multiple sclerosis.

GSE180949	2021.08.16	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	375	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Dietary suppression of MHC-II expression in intestinal epithelial cells enhances intestinal tumorigenesis	Little is known about how interactions between diet, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and immune cells impact the early steps of intestinal tumorigenesis. Here, we show that a high fat diet (HFD) reduces the expression of the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) genes in intestinal epithelial cells including ISCs. This decline in epithelial MHC-II expression in a HFD correlates with reduced diversity of the intestinal microbiome and is recapitulated in antibiotic treated and germ-free mice on a control diet. Mechanistically, pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and IFN g signaling regulate epithelial MHC-II expression where genetic ablation of these signaling pathways dampen MHC-II epithelial expression. Interestingly, upon loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc in a HFD, MHC-II- ISCs harbor greater in vivo tumor-initiating capacity than their MHC-II+ counterparts when transplanted into immune-component hosts but not immune-deficient hosts, thus implicating a role for epithelial MHC-II-mediated immune surveillance in suppressing tumorigenesis. Finally, ISC-specific genetic ablation of MHC-II in engineered Apc-mediated intestinal tumor models increases tumor burden in a cell autonomous manner. These findings highlight how a HFD perturbs a microbiome – stem cell – immune cell crosstalk in the intestine and contributes to tumor initiation through the dampening of MHC-II expression in pre-malignant ISCs.

CAR-NK cells may exert less toxicity when redirected against resistant myeloma cells. CARs can be designed through the use of receptors, such as NKG2D, which recognizes a wide range of ligands to provide broad target specificity. Here, we test this approach by analyzing the anti-tumor activity of activated and expanded NK cells (NKAE) and CD45RA- T cells from MM patients that were engineered to express an NKG2D-based CAR. NKAE cells were cultured with irradiated Clone9.mbIL21 cells. Then, cells were transduced with an NKG2D-4-1BB-CD3z-CAR. CAR-NKAE cells exhibited no evidence of genetic abnormalities. Although memory T cells were more stably transduced, CAR-NKAE cells exhibited greater in vitro cytotoxicity against MM cells, while showing minimal activity against healthy cells. In vivo, CAR-NKAE cells mediated highly efficient abrogation of MM growth, and two of the treated mice remained disease-free. Overall, these results demonstrate that it is feasible to modify autologous NKAE cells from MM patients to safely express a NKG2D-CAR. Additionally, autologous CAR-NKAE cells display enhanced anti-myeloma activity demonstrating that they could be an effective strategy against MM supporting the development of NKG2D-CAR NK cell therapy for MM.

In vitro preclinical models mimicking biomechanical forces, cellular microenvironment, and 3D organization of B-cell lymphomas remain scarce, while all these parameters constitute key determinants of lymphomagenesis and drug resistance. Using a microfluidic method based on cell encapsulation inside permeable, elastic, and hollow alginate microspheres, we developed a new tunable 3D-model incorporating lymphoma B cells, extracellular matrix and/or stromal cells.Using RNA-sequencing, we reported that, in contrast to classical 2D cocultures, our 3D lymphoma model initiated a coevolution of these two cell types, recapitulating the physiopathology of B lymphoma tissue.		3D;2D;DOHH2;no stroma;stroma;Lymphoma B cell line;Lymphoma B cell line/ primary tonsil stromal cells;HLY1

We mapped the molecular pathways regulating intratumoral cDC1 maturation using single cell RNA sequencing. We identified NF-κB and IFN pathways as being highly enriched in a subset of functionally mature cDC1s. The specific targeting of NF-κB or IFN pathways in cDC1s prevented the recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells and the control of tumor growth. We identified an NF-κB-dependent IFN-γ-regulated gene network in cDC1s, including cytokines and chemokines specialized in the recruitment and activation of cytotoxic T cells. We used single cell transcriptomes to map the trajectory of intra-tumoral cDC1 maturation which revealed the dynamic reprogramming of tumor-infiltrating cDC1s by NF-κB and IFN signaling pathways. This maturation process was perturbed by specific inactivation of either NF-κB or IRF1 in cDC1s, resulting in impaired expression of IFN-γ-responsive genes and consequently a failure to efficiently recruit and activate anti-tumoral CD8+ T cells. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of these findings to cancer patients, showing that activation of the NF-κB/IRF1 axis in association with cDC1s is linked with improved clinical outcome. The NF-κB/IRF1 axis in cDC1s may therefore represent an important focal point for the development new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to improve cancer immunotherapy.

Recently single-cell technologies such as CITE-seq have been developed that enable simultaneous quantitative analysis of cell-surface receptor expression with transcriptional states. To date, these datasets have not been used to systematically develop cell-context-specific maps of the interface between signaling and transcriptional regulators orchestrating cellular identity and function. We present SPaRTAN (Single-cell Proteomic and RNA based Transcription factor Activity Network), a computational method to link cell-surface receptors to transcription factors (TFs) by exploiting cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) datasets with cis-regulatory information. SPaRTAN is applied to immune cell types in the blood to predict the coupling of signaling receptors with cell context-specific TFs. The predictions are validated by prior knowledge and flow cytometry analyses. SPaRTAN is then used to predict the signaling coupled TF states of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells in malignant peritoneal and pleural mesotheliomas. SPaRTAN greatly enhances the utility of CITE-seq datasets to uncover TF and cell-surface receptor relationships in diverse cellular states.		peritoneum;malignant mesotheliomas;pleura

How premature AR is avoided despite rapid surges in signaling cascades during capacitation remains unknown. Using a combination of KO mice and cell-penetrating peptides, here we show that GIV (CCDC88A), a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEM) for trimeric GTPases, is highly expressed in spermatocytes and is required for male fertility. GIV is rapidly phosphoregulated on key tyrosine and serine residues in human and murine sperms. These phosphomodifications enable GIV-GEM to orchestrate two distinct compartmentalized signaling programs in the sperm tail and head; in the tail, GIV enhances PI3K→Akt signals, sperm motility and survival, whereas in the head it inhibits cAMP surge and premature AR. Furthermore, GIV transcripts are downregulated in the testes and semen of infertile men. These findings exemplify the spatiotemporally segregated signaling programs that support sperm capacitation and the etiology of infertility in men.

We employed single-cell RNA sequencing in models of early treatment response and resistance to enzalutamide. In doing so, we identified pre-existing and treatment-persistent cell subpopulations that possess transcriptional stem-like features and regenerative potential when subjected to treatment. We found distinct chromatin landscapes associated with enzalutamide treatment and resistance that are linked to alternative transcriptional programs. Transcriptional profiles characteristic of persistent stem-like cells were able to stratify the treatment response of patients. Ultimately, we show that defining changes in chromatin and gene expression in single-cell populations from pre-clinical models can reveal hitherto unrecognized molecular predictors of treatment response. This suggests that high analytical resolution of pre-clinical models may powerfully inform clinical decision-making.

Here we report, in a pre-clinical advanced ID8 ovarian cancer model, that metronomic low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT; 1 Gy) promotes T-cell infiltration and enables responsiveness to treatment including low-dose cyclophosphamide (CP), and combinatorial IMT comprising immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4, and anti-CD40 agonist antibody, for significant tumor control and survival. Responses to this radio-combinatorial immunotherapy (RACIM) relied upon re-programming of both innate and adaptive immunity. We further identified RACIM-induced intratumoral dendritic cell states with co-stimulatory capacity and expressing the stress ligand RAE1, as well as of polyfunctional NKG2D+TCF1-PD1+CD4+T cells. We further report major tumor regressions in a subset of advanced cancer patients for which cold tumors were treated with LDRT, CP, aspirin, and ICB (NCT03728179).

After 12 weeks of implantation, samples from the 0%-Axitinib group and 3%-Axitinib group were harvested, with the murine tissues entangled. Transcriptional profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using an Illumina HiSeqTM2000 machine, and filtered using Fastp software. The trimmed reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10, genome.UCSC.edu) using the STAR software to identify the transcriptional information in the niche of engineered cartilage. Then, the DESeq2 “counts” function of the R package was used to normalize gene expression levels based on the number of total reads of each sample. Differentially expressed genes between the 0%-Axitinib group and 3%-Axitinib group were identified as meeting the criteria of fold change ≥ 1.5 and P-value＜0.05. Lastly, we used Metascape (http://metascape.org) for gene ontology analysis. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 20 to 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm10) and identified 20318 transcripts in the 0%-Axitinib and 3%-Axitinib groups. 837 genes were differentially expressed by more than 1.5-fold, p-value <0.05, with 313 genes downregulated and 524 genes upregulated in the 3%-Axitinib group. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the genes downregulated in the 3%-Axitinib group were mainly enriched in endothelial development, angiogenesis, and immune response. Genes upregulated in the 3%-Axitinib group were mainly enriched in response to hypoxia, Hif-1 signaling pathway, cartilage differentiation and development, and muscle structure development. Altered expression of 15 genes was further illustrated by heatmap, demonstrating the inhibited angiogenesis and improved chondrogenesis. Especially, Timp1, as a response to hypoxia, was remarkably upregulated, which also in turn inhibited the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and played an important role in preventing ossification. Conclusion: In this study, we proposed the first detailed transcriptional analysis of the effects of the sustainable and localized release of axitinib on the subcutaneous niche of engineered cartilage. The sustainable and localized release of axitinib created a relatively avascular, hypoxia, and low immune response niche in the 3%-Axitinib group. In this niche, Timp1 was remarkably upregulated, which inhibited the activity of MMPs and prevented endochondral ossification.		untreated;12 weeks post-implantaion;BALB/c nude;Subcutaneous tissues surrounding engineered cartilage;Subcutaneous tissues;3% Axitinib treatment

RNAseq analyses of RV free wall at P14 and P21from VO and sham-operated mice revealed that there were 981 differentially expressed genes between VO and sham group at P14, this number increased to 1907 at P21, there were 3012 differentially expressed genes between P21 and P14 sham group, and the number increased to 3470 at the presence of VO. GO analysis showed that in the VO and sham comparison, the upregulated genes mainly mediated mitosis and cell division and the downregulated genes mainly mediated heart contraction at P14, and the upregulated genes mainly mediated immune response, and downregulated genes mainly mediated cellular respiration at P21. As expected, in the normal RV development during preadolescence (from P14 to P21), upregulated genes mainly mediated oxidative phosphorylation and cellular respiration and the downregulated genes mainly mediated vasculogenesis. VO changed the RV development, the upregulated genes mainly mediated heart contraction and the down regulated genes mainly mediated vasculogenesis and cell cycle. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that cell cycle pathway was upregulated and cardiac muscle contraction and thyroid hormone signaling pathway were downregulated between VO and sham group at P14, phagosome pathway was upregulated and citrate cycle (TCA) cycle and thermogenesis were downregulated at P21 between VO and sham group. In the normal RV development, TCA cycle and cardiac muscle contraction pathway were upregulated while VO changed that to the upregulations of cardiomyopathy pathways and thyroid hormone signaling pathway. All the above changes were further confirmed by the functional tests.		volume overload(AVF);postnatal day 7;postnatal day 21;operated-sham;myocardium;postnatal day 14;C57BL/6;RV free wall myocardium

Here we report that the epigenetic regulator Ezh2 is essential for YS hematopoiesis but dispensable for subsequent aorta–gonad–mesonephros (AGM) blood development. Loss of Ezh2 activity in hemogenic endothelium (HE) leads to the generation of phenotypically intact but functionally deficient erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMP). Ezh2 activity is critical at the onset of the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition generating EMPs but rapidly dispensable after that. We identified a lack of downregulation of Wnt signaling as the primary reason in the generation of non-functional EMPs. Together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role of Ezh2 in modulating Wnt signaling during the generation of EMPs from YS HE.

We find that this methylation is important for modulating translation of distinct mRNAs, leading to phenotypic changes including modulation of cell proliferation rate.		ribosome protected fragment RNA;HelaS3-SNORD45C-KO;HelaS3 cells;total RNA;wild type;HelaS3 SNORD45C knockout cells;HelaS3

Although successful derivation of hTSCs from the early placentas and blastocysts, these hTSCs face ethical concerns and limited models for trophoblast-related disorders at later stage, such as preeclampsia. Here, we show that both hESCs and hiPSCs are able to be induced to the long-term and proliferative hTSCs under defined culture medium. These induced trophoblast stem cells (iTSCs) are comparable to the hTSC cell line derived from blastocyst in morphology, growth properties, specific genes expression, capacity of differentiating toward extravillous cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast, and patterns of transcriptome profile, chromatin accessibility and histone modification that are conducive to placenta development and maintenance of hTSCs. Notably, iTSCs meet four criteria defining "trophoblastic" including: expression of specific transcript factors, hypomethylation of ELF5 promoter, lack of expression of HLA-class I molecules and expression of the chromosome 19-encoded miRNA. Moreover, we reveal that addition of BMP4 or absence of H3K27 methyltransferases EZH1/2 could enhance the iTSCs generation. Our results suggest that human TS cells could be derived from human pluripotent stem cells, which expands the source of human TS cells avoiding ethic issues and provides a useful tool for researching placenta development and function, and modeling placenta-originated disorders.		human embryonic stem cell H1 derived cells;human trophoblast stem cells;WT;human embryonic stem cells;human embryonic stem cell HN10 derived cells;human trophoblast stem cell line;human embryonic stem cell H1;human embryonic stem cell HN10

Both PAX-FOXO1s drive related cell transformation in animal models, yet the two mutations are associated with distinct pathological manifestations in patients. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying these differences, we generated isogenic fibroblast lines expressing either PAX-FOXO1 paralog. Mapping their genome recruitment using CUT&Tag revealed that the two chimeric proteins have distinct DNA binding preferences. Furthermore, PAX7-FOXO1 causes stronger de novo transactivation of its bound regions than PAX3-FOXO1, resulting in greater transcriptomic dynamics involving genes regulating cell shape and cycle. Consistently, PAX3-FOXO1 accentuates fibroblast cellular traits associated with contractility and surface adhesion and limits entry to M phase. Instead, PAX7-FOXO1 pushes cells to adopt an amoeboid-like shape, reduce S phase entry and provokes more genome instabilities. Altogether, our results demonstrate that PAX7-FOXO1 has a greater chromatin remodelling and transactivating abilities and is more deleterious to cells than PAX3-FOXO1. Altogether our results argue that the diversity in rhabdomyosarcoma manifestation stems, in part, from the diverging transcriptional activity of PAX3-FOXO1 and PAX7-FOXO1. Furthermore, PAX7-FOXO1 pronounced deleterious effects provides an explanation for the low frequency of the translocation generating this factor in Rhabdomyosarcoma patients.

A variety of molecular mechanisms have been implicated in PD pathogenesis, but the mechanisms underlying PDD and DLB remain largely unknown, a knowledge gap that presents an impediment to the discovery of diseasemodifying therapies. Transcriptomic profiling can contribute to addressing this gap, but remains limited in the LBDs. Here, we applied paired bulk-tissue and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to anterior cingulate cortex samples derived from 28 individuals, including healthy controls, PD, PDD and DLB cases (n = 7 per group), to transcriptomically profile the LBDs. Using this approach, we (i) found transcriptional alterations in multiple cell types across the LBDs; (ii) discovered evidence for widespread dysregulation of RNA splicing, particularly in PDD and DLB; (iii) identified potential splicing factors, with links to other dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases, coordinating this dysregulation; and (iv) identified transcriptomic commonalities and distinctions between the LBDs that inform understanding of the relationships between these three clinical disorders. Together, these findings have important implications for the design of RNA-targeted therapies for these diseases and highlight a potential molecular “window” of therapeutic opportunity between the initial onset of PD and subsequent development of Lewy body dementia.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with PD1 or PDL1 antibodies has been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, only a minority of the patients respond and sustained remissions are rare. Both chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs may improve tumor response to ICB in mouse models and patients with cancer. Here, we used genetically engineered mouse models of KrasG12D/p53null NSCLC, including a mismatch repair-deficient variant (KrasG12D/p53null/Msh2null) with higher mutational burden, and longitudinal imaging to study tumor response and resistance to combinations of ICB, anti-angiogenic therapy, and chemotherapy. Anti-angiogenic blockade of VEGFA and angiopoietin-2 markedly slowed progression of established tumors but, contrary to findings in other mouse cancer models, addition of a PD1 or PDL1 antibody was not beneficial and even accelerated progression of some of the tumors. We found that anti-angiogenic treatment facilitated tumor infiltration by PD1+ regulatory T cells (T-regs), which were more efficiently targeted by the PD1 antibody than CD8+ T cells. Both tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of bone-marrow origin, which are CSF1R-dependent, and TAMs of alveolar origin, which are sensitive to cisplatin, contributed to establishing a TGFB-rich tumor microenvironment that supported PD1+ T-regs. Dual TAM targeting with a combination of cisplatin and a CSF1R inhibitor fully abated T-regs, redirected the PD1 antibody to CD8+ T cells, and improved the efficacy of anti-angiogenic immunotherapy, achieving regression of the majority of the tumors.

Main Methods: The protocol included blood collection before (baseline), during (peak of exercise, measured by VO2 max), and after exercise challenge (recovery – four hours post-exercise challenge). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomics data were analyzed using DESeq2 and DEXseq software to understand why GWI patients process stressors differently from their healthy counterparts. Key findings: Our findings validate previously identified dysregulation of immune and inflammatory pathways among GWI patients as well as highlight novel immune and inflammatory markers of disease activity. These results provide a foundation for future research efforts in understanding GWI pathophysiology and creating targeted treatments. Significance: Gulf War Illness is a complex, chronic, and debilitating multi-system illness impacting 25%-30% of the U.S. troops deployed to the 1990-1991 Gulf War. The condition is characterized by medically unexplained fatigue and affects multiple organ systems. Because the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, patients receive symptom-based treatment, rather than targeting fundamental biological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that applies RNA-Seq to analyze the effect of GWI, and the response to stressors in GWI, on the transcriptomic changes in circulating immune cells.

Here, we developed pathway-based signatures that predict response of metastatic melanoma to anti-PD1-based therapies in four independent datasets with RNAseq and clinical response data available for both pre- and on-treatment metastatic melanomas. We first identified pathway signatures that were significantly enriched in tumor specimens from anti-PD1 responders (R) compared to non-responders (NR) at pre-treatment and on-treatment time points, respectively. We also identified pathway signatures that were differentially expressed in pre-treatment versus on-treatment samples derived from R. Finally, we interrogated the capacity of the two types of signatures in predicting response of metastatic melanoma to anti-PD1 therapies in comparison with existing gene expression signatures. And we also investigated the effect of biopsy sites at the same biopsy time point on predictive performance of response to anti-PD1 therapy. Overall, we demonstrate that pathway-based signatures derived from on-treatment tumor specimens are highly predictive of response to anti-PD1 blockade therapies in patients with metastatic melanoma.

We previously showed that offspring from dams given lactational high fat diet (HFD) are predisposed to obesity, glucose intolerance and inflammation. The purpose of these studies was to understand the programming implications of lactational HFD on offspring metabolic liver disease risk. Dams were fed a 60% lard-based HFD from the day of delivery through the 21 day lactation period. Starting at weaning offspring were fed normal fat diet until 3 months of age at which point a subset were challenged with an additional HFD stressor. Lactational HFD fed male offspring developed hepatic insulin resistance. Postweaning HFD challenge led male offspring progressing to NAFLD with more severe outcomes in the lactational HFD challenged offspring.		Control;Liver;HFD

Here we report an essential role for astroglial SOX2 in brain anomalies and neurological defects. Sox2-deficiency inhibited postnatal astrocyte maturation without affecting astroglial proliferation and population expansion. Mechanistically, we found that SOX2 directly bound to a cohort of astrocytic signature genes such as those involving in glutamate transport and that Sox2-deficiency remarkably reduced glutamate transporter expression and compromised astrocyte function of glutamate uptake. Behaviorally, astroglial Sox2-deficient mice developed hyperactivity in locomotion while their motor skills, social capability, and learning abilities were unaffected. We found that astroglial Sox2-deficiency results in elevated glutamatergic synapse formation and elevated excitability of striatal medium spiny neurons, which has been shown to trigger hyperactive locomotion. Our study provides new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying brain defects in children with SOX2 mutations and unveils a novel connection between astrocyte SOX2 and brain development and behavior.		mGfap-Cre:Sox2+/+;mGfap-Cre:Sox2fl/fl;post natal day 90 (P90);spinal cord;spinal cord cells;C57BL/6

We identified the overexpression of interferon-stimulated genes across most immune cell types post SFTSV infection, which were simultaneously related to older age, high viremia and hyper-inflammation. These data collectively supported the intermediate monocytes and IFN-I-inducible plasmablasts to be major targets for SFTSV infection, and proposed the pivotal role of IFN-I response in exacerbating hyper-inflammation and lethal SFTS, which might help to identify therapeutic strategies for SFTS.		--;Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS);Control;Convalescent;Acute;Peripheral blood mononuclear cells;female;male

To test the broader specificity of elevated IgG-VN-Glyc, we studied patients with distinct subtypes of myasthenia gravis (MG), a B cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Our experimental design included adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing to quantify and characterize N-glycosylation sites in the global B cell receptor repertoire, proteomics to examine glycosylation patterns of the circulating IgG, and production of human-derived recombinant autoantibodies, which were studied with mass spectrometry and antigen binding assays to confirm occupation of glycosylation sites and determine whether they alter binding. We found that the frequency of IgG-VN-Glyc motifs was increased in the B cell repertoire of MG patients when compared to healthy donors. Motifs were introduced by both biased V gene segment usage and somatic hypermutation. IgG-VN-Glyc could be observed in the circulating IgG in a subset of MG patients. Autoantigen binding, by patient-derived MG autoantigen-specific monoclonal antibodies with experimentally confirmed presence of IgG-VN-Glyc, was not altered by the glycosylation. Our findings extend prior work on patterns of variable region N-linked glycosylation in autoimmunity to MG subtypes. Although occupied IgG-VN-Glyc motifs are found on MG autoantigen-specific monoclonal antibodies, they are not required for binding to the autoantigen in this disease.

GSE182019	2021.08.13	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	47	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Epithelial TGFβ activation engages growth-factor signalling to circumvent cell death and drive intestinal tumorigenesis with aggressive features.	The pro-tumourigenic role of epithelial TGFβ in colorectal cancer (CRC) has been controversial. Here we identify a cohort of aggressive ‘bad acting’ early-stage (T1) disseminating tumours characterised by high cell-intrinsic TGFβ signalling emanating from the epithelium, not stroma. To address its functional significance, we activated TGFβ signalling in the murine intestinal epithelium either alone or in concert with the common tumour suppressive and oncogenic mutations found in CRC, namely Apc and Kras. Consistent with previous studies, we found that activation of TGFβ rapidly induced apoptosis in Apc-mutant intestine and completely killed Apc-mutant organoids. However, in the presence of both Apc and Kras mutation, activation of TGFβ within the epithelium rampantly accelerates tumourigenesis. Importantly the transcriptional signatures derived from these mice overlapped with the “bad acting” T1 human tumours and this signalling could also predict recurrence in stage II CRC. Mechanistically, the activation of intrinsic TGFβ induced the expression of a growth-factor signalling module containing EGFR that synergised with Apc and Kras to drive marked activation of MAPK signalling. Importantly, inhibition of MEK and/or EGFR suppressed the acceleration conferred by TGFβ even in Kras-mutant cells, which are refractory to MEK/EGFR inhibition in the absence of epithelial TGFβ. Together, we identify both a determinant of early dissemination and a potential vulnerability for tumours with these born-to-be-bad traits.

However, current anti-doping testing does not involve blood collection into tubes with RNA preservative. This study investigated if whole blood in long-term storage and whole blood leftover from standard haematological testing in short-term storage could be used for transcriptomic analysis despite lacking RNA preservative. Whole blood samples were collected from thirteen and fourteen healthy males, for long-term and short-term storage experiments. Long-term storage: whole blood collected into Tempus™ tubes and K2EDTA tubes and subjected to long-term (i.e., −80°C) storage and RNA extracted. After storage, K2EDTA tubes were thawed and extracted using GeneJET RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) or Tempus™ Spin RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA quality and purity was sufficient for gene expression analysis. Principle Component Analysis of microarray and RNA-seq gene expression data for long-term storage: When comparing gene expression between blood tubes with and without RNA preservation, 6% (4058 transcripts) were differentially expressed. RNA quantity, purity and integrity was not significantly compromised from long-term storage in blood storage tubes lacking RNA preservative, indicating that transcriptomic analysis could be conducted using anti-doping samples collected or biobanked without RNA preservation.

T-stochastic neighbor embedding analysis of single cell transcriptome data revealed 12 myeloid cell clusters, nine of which paralleled previously described HC Mφ/DC clusters and three of which were dcSSc-specific myeloid cell clusters. One SSc-associated macrophage cluster, highly expressing FCGR3A, on pseudotime analysis was suggested to derive from normal CCR1+ and MARCO+ macrophages. A second SSc-associated myeloid population, highly expressed monocyte markers: FCN1, EREG, S100A8 and S100A9, but was closely related to cDC2 on pseudotime analysis and identified as Mo-DC. Mo-DC were associated with more severe skin disease. Proliferating macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells were detected almost exclusively in dcSSc skin, the latter clustering with B cells and apparently derived from lymphoid progenitors. Transcriptional signatures in these and other myeloid populations indicate innate immune activation, possibly through TLRs, and highly upregulated chemokines. However, the appearance and activation of myeloid cells is variable between patients, indicating differing underlying pathogenesis and/or temporal disease activity.		dorsal, mid-forearm skin biopsy;10X Genomics 3 Prime V2 chemistry;scleroderma;skin

The molecular basis underlying this correlation is not clear. USP22 is the catalytic subunit of the deubiquitylation module in the SAGA histone modifying complex, which regulates gene transcription. Our previous work demonstrated that loss of USP22 in mice leads to decreased expression of several components of receptor tyrosine kinase and TGFβ signaling pathways. To determine whether these pathways are upregulated when USP22 is overexpressed, we created a mouse model that expresses high levels of USP22 in all tissues. Phenotypic characterization of these mice revealed over branching of the mammary glands in females. Transcriptomic analyses indicate upregulation of key pathways involved in mammary gland branching in mammary epithelial cells derived from the USP22 overexpressing mice, including estrogen receptor, ERK/MAPK and TGFβ signaling. However, USP22 overexpression did not lead to increased tumorigenesis in any tissue. Our findings indicate that elevated levels of USP22 are not sufficient to induce tumors but it may enhance signaling abnormalities associated with oncogenesis.

BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, are also known to induce ATF4 in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells, but the mechanisms of ATF4 induction are not fully elucidated. Here, we show that ATF4 expression can be upregulated by eIF4B (eukaryotic initiation factor 4B) in BRAF-mutated A375 cells. In fact, knockout (KO) of eIF4B hindered ATF4 induction as well as ATF4 translation mechanism under vemurafenib treatment, which were effectively recovered by rescue of eIF4B. Transcriptome analysis revealed that eIF4B KO selectively affected ATF4-target gene expression among gene expression altered by vemurafenib. Our results indicate that eIF4B can contribute to cellular stress adaptation by regulating ATF4 expression.

We sought to understand the cellular populations present in the esophageal biopsies of patients with EoE and to determine how these populations are altered between active disease and remission. To this end, we analyzed cells from the esophageal biopsies, duodenal biopsies, and peripheral blood of EoE patients in active disease or remission using single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing. We identified gene modules regulated by transcription factors from the NF-κB family that characterize activated eosinophils in patients with active disease. Pathogenic effector Th2 (peTh2) cells present in the esophageal biopsies of patients with active disease expressed unique gene signatures associated with the synthesis of eicosanoids that are predicted to directly promote activation of tissue-resident eosinophils. The tissue-resident peTh2 population also exhibited clonal expansion, suggesting antigen-specific activation. Peripheral CRTH2+CD161+ and CRTH2+CD161- memory CD4+ T cells were enriched for either a conventional Th2 phenotype or a peTh2 phenotype, respectively. These cells also exhibited significant clonal expansion and convergence of TCR sequences, indicating that these cells are expanded in response to a defined set of antigens. The esophagus-homing receptor GPR15 was upregulated by peripheral peTh2 clonotypes that were also detected in the esophagus. Lastly, peTh2 cells and GPR15+ cells were enriched among milk-reactive CD4+ T cells in patients with milk-triggered disease, suggesting that peTh2 cells in EoE are an expanded, food antigen-specific population with enhanced esophagus homing potential.

Here we report that low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) in mice promotes tumor T-cell inflammation and enables responsiveness to combinatorial immunotherapyin an interferon-dependent manner. Treatment efficacy relied upon mobilizing both adaptive and innate immunity, and depended on both cytotoxic CD4+and CD8+T cells. LDRTinduced predominantly CD4+cells which exhibited features of exhausted effector and cytotoxic cells, with a subset expressing NKG2D and exhibiting proliferative capacity, and a novel subset of dendritic cells with activated phenotype that expressed the NKG2D ligand Rae1. Finally, tumor immune rejection was critically dependent on the NKG2D pathway. We translated these findings toa phase I clinical trial. Like in mice, combinatorial treatmenttriggered peripheral T-cell mobilization and resulted in important tumor T-cell infiltration, predominantly of CD4+cells and with Th1 signatures, observed only in patients with immune desert tumors who responded to a novel combination of LDRT, low dose cyclophosphamide and immune checkpoint blockade therapy.These results suggest the novel possibility of rationally combining LDRT with immune checkpoint therapy for the treatment of cold tumors, based on the simultaneous activation of antitumoral innate and adaptive immunity		Tumor_0XUL_pre;PR;pre_screening;Tumor_02F5_pre;19F7;SD;Tumor_1EEY_on;Tumor_0XE2_on;Tumor_12UI_pre;Gallbladder;Tumor_095T_pre;Tumor_02F5_on;Tumor_12UI_on;on_treatment;Recto_Sigmoidal;Tumor_0XE2_pre;095T;12UI;0XE2;02F5;0XUL;Ovarian;Tumor_19F7_on;tumors;PD;Tumor_095T_on;Tumor_0XUL_on;Tumor_1EEY_pre;Prostate;1EEY

Despite absent expression in normal hematopoietic lineages, the Forkhead family transcription factor FOXC1, which is a critical regulator of normal mesenchymal and mesodermal differentiation, is highly expressed in ~20% of cases of AML where it confers a block to monocyte/macrophage lineage differentiation. Through integrated proteomics and bioinformatics approaches, we discovered that FOXC1 interacts with RUNX1 through its Forkhead DNA binding domain and that the two factors co-occupy a discrete set of primed or active enhancers distributed close to monocyte/macrophage differentiation genes. FOXC1 stabilises association of RUNX1, HDAC1 and the Groucho family repressor protein TLE3 at these sites. FOXC1 knockdown induced loss of these repressor proteins and gain of CEBPA binding, with localised increase in enhancer acetylation; nearby genes, including KLF2, were up regulated. A genome-wide redistribution of RUNX1 and TLE3 binding from enhancers to promoters was triggered by FOXC1 knockdown leading to repression of self-renewal genes including MYC and MYB. Thus, FOXC1 misexpression confers a differentiation block in AML by stabilising recruitment of a RUNX1/HDAC1/TLE3 repressor complex at primed or active enhancers close to genes which control monocyte/macrophage lineage differentiation.

In systemic sclerosis (SSc) evidence suggests abnormal keratinocyte-fibroblast interactions. We investigated the potential epidermal dysfunction in SSc and its effects on dermis homeostasis. Epidermal equivalents (EE) were generated from six healthy donor (HD) and four SSc keratinocytes. Skin and EE expression of proliferation, differentiation, and activation markers was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The transcriptomic profile of SSc-EE and HD-EE was identified by RNAseq analysis. EE conditioned medium (CM) was used to stimulate fibroblasts, and their production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, type-I collagen (col-I), and fibronectin was assessed by ELISA. Compared to HD, SSc-EE exhibited aberrant differentiation, enhanced expression of activation markers, and lower mitotic rate of basal keratinocytes, reproducing most of the abnormalities observed in SSc epidermis. RNAseq analysis revealed that, compared to HD-EE, SSc-EE were characterized by the downregulation of HOX gene family members and by the upregulation of metabolic and oxidative stress molecular pathways. EE-CM enhanced the fibroblast production of IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1, Col-I, and fibronectin (p<0.05). Except for Col-I and fibronectin, this effect was 2-fold higher in the presence of CM generated form SSc-EE. IL-1 was, at least in part, responsible for keratinocyte-dependent fibroblast activation. SSc-EE recapitulate the in vivo characteristic of SSc epidermis demonstrating that SSc keratinocytes have an intrinsically altered differentiation program possibly due to the downregulation of genes from the HOX family. The increased metabolic and oxidative stress associated with SSc epidermis may participate to dermis chronic inflammation and fibrosis		systemic sclerosis (SSc);epidermal equivalent [EE);Epidermal_Equivalent_SSc;Epidermal_Equivalent_healty_donor;healthy donor (HD);keratinocytes

Progression to T1D onset is a chronic process, which suggests that the effector activity of β-cell autoreactive CD8 T cells needs to be maintained throughout the course of disease development. The mechanism that sustains diabetogenic CD8 T cell effectors during the course of T1D progression has not been completely defined. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to gain further insight into the phenotypic complexity of islet-infiltrating CD8 T cells in NOD mice. We identified two functionally distinct subsets of activated CD8 T cells, CD44highTCF1+CXCR6- and CD44highTCF1-CXCR6+, in islets of prediabetic NOD mice. Compared to CD44highTCF1+CXCR6- CD8 T cells, the CD44highTCF1-CXCR6+ subset expressed higher levels of inhibitory and cytotoxic molecules and was more prone to apoptosis. Adoptive cell transfer experiments revealed that CD44highTCF1+CXCR6- CD8 T cells, through continuous generation of the CD44highTCF1-CXCR6+ subset, were more capable than the latter population to promote insulitis and the development of T1D. We further showed that direct interleukin-27 (IL-27) signaling in CD8 T cells promoted the generation of terminal effectors from the CD44highTCF1+CXCR6- population. These results indicate that islet CD44highTCF1+CXCR6- CD8 T cells are a progenitor-like subset with self-renewing capacity and under an IL-27 controlled mechanism they differentiate into the CD44highTCF1-CXCR6+ terminal effector population. Our study provides new insight into the sustainability of the CD8 T cell response in the pathogenesis of T1D.		7_week;CD45.1+ cells;12_week;12 weeks old;NOD/ShiLtJ;7 weeks old;immune cells isolated from pancreatic islets;female

Recent studies strongly suggest that roughly 30% of DIPG tumors contain copy number increases in platelet derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA). We established a novel mouse model by knocking in the human PDGFRA conditional to Cre exposure by crossing in germline Olig2-Cre (specific to oligodendrocytes). This knock in is used in conjuction with p53 tumor suppressor knockout conditional to cre exposure as well. Mutants contain the PDGFRA KI allele, while wild-types only contain p53 floxed alleles with Olig2-Cre. At 18 days of age, mutants demonstrate tremors and hind limb paralysis, and die shortly thereafter. The goal is to determine the differences in brain stems near the time of death in the presence of the PDGFRA mutation when compared to controls without this mutation.		untreated;Control 11C;Control 10C;brain stem;Control 12C;Mut 3;Mut 2;Mut 13;Control 5C;Mut 1;C57BL/6

Because cellular context is often reflective of environmental exposure, mapping context-specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and identifying the cellular contexts that modify their effects is critical for understanding the mechanisms by which gene by environment interactions confer disease risk. Here, we introduce a compressed pooling framework for performing genetically multiplexed arrayed single-cell sequencing experiments without the need for prior genotyping. To this end, we developed freemuxlet, an extension of demuxlet, that enables genotype-free demultiplexing of pooled single-cell data applicable to multiplexed single cell RNA- and CITE-seq data. In total, we performed multiplexed CITE-seq across 384 samples from 64 donors over 12 pools in a single day. These results allowed us to generate a map of cell-type specific gene regulatory networks in response to each stimulus. Finally, by integrating imputed genotypes from the individuals, we map genetic variants associated with stimulation in each specific cell type and assess their enrichment for disease associations. Freemuxlet and clue together demonstrate the feasibility of performing population-scale gene-by-environment studies using single-cell RNA-sequencing scalable to between 100 – 1000 individuals.

Knowledge on underlying mechanisms essential for advanced therapies to attenuate these pathologies is limited. Injection of ABCB5+ stromal precursors (SPs) at the edge of non-healing diabetic wounds in a murine db/db model, closely mirroring human type II diabetes, profoundly accelerates wound closure. Strikingly, enhanced angiogenesis was substantially enforced by the release of the ribonuclease angiogenin from ABCB5+ SPs. This compensates for the profoundly reduced angiogenin expression in non-treated murine and human chronic diabetic wounds. Silencing of angiogenin in ABCB5+ SPs prior to injection significantly reduced angiogenesis, reduced numbers of M2 macrophages and delayed wound closure in diabetic db/db mice implying an unprecedented key role for angiogenin in tissue regeneration in diabetes. These data hold significant promise for further refining SPs-based therapies of non-healing diabetic foot ulcers and other pathologies with impaired angiogenesis.		db/db;db/db MDF;vein;wildtype MDF;HUVEC;artery;Endothelial cells;C57BL/6
GSE181827	2021.08.12	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Short duplex RNAs induce potent immunostimulation via Hoogsteen G-G base pairing-mediated dimerization	Here we describe a new class of immunostimulatory short duplex RNAs that potently induce production of type I interferon (IFN-I), and particularly IFN-β, in a wide range of human cell types via end-to-end dimerization, direct binding to RIG-I, and activation of the RIG-I/IRF3 pathway. These RNAs require a minimum of 20 base pairs, lack any sequence or structural characteristics of known immunostimulatory RNAs, and instead require a unique conserved sequence motif (sense strand: 5’-C, antisense strand: 3’-GGG) that mediates the self-assembly of end-to-end RNA dimers by Hoogsteen G-G base-pairing. The presence of terminal hydroxyl or monophosphate groups, blunt or overhanging ends, or terminal RNA or DNA bases also did not affect their ability to induce IFN-I production. Immune stimulation mediated by these duplex RNAs results in broad spectrum inhibition of infections by many respiratory viruses with pandemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza A, as well as the common cold virus HCoV-NL63 in cell lines and in human Lung Chips that mimic organlevel lung pathophysiology. These novel immunostimulatory motifs potentially could be harnessed to create broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics, but they should be avoided when designing siRNAs to minimize immunological side effects.		human lung carcinoma epithelial cells;A549 cells;scramble control;dsRNA-1;dsRNA-2

Here we introduce EcoTyper, a new machine learning framework for large-scale identification and validation of cell states and multicellular communities from bulk, single-cell, and spatially-resolved gene expression data. When applied to 12 major cell lineages across 16 types of human carcinoma, EcoTyper identified 69 transcriptionally-defined cell states. Most states were specific to neoplastic tissue, ubiquitous across tumor types, and significantly prognostic. By analyzing cell state co-occurrence patterns, we discovered 10 clinically-distinct multicellular communities with unexpectedly strong conservation, including four with unique myeloid and stromal elements, one enriched in normal tissue, and two associated with early cancer development.

Using congenically labeled JHMV-specific Tregs, we found that virus-specific Tregs persist long-term after infection, through at least 180 days post-infection. We additionally demonstrate that these cells are better able to proliferate after infection than naïve Tregs of the same specificity, further suggesting that these cells differentiate into memory Tregs upon encountering cognate antigen. Together, these data suggest that virus-specific Tregs are able to persist long-term in the absence of viral antigen as memory Tregs.

Health effects of krill oil (KrO) on obesity-associated inflammation remain largely elusive, because long-term treatments with KrO have not been performed so far. In this study, mice were fed an obesogenic diet (HFD) containing 3% (w/w) KrO for 28 weeks. KrO treatment increased the concentrations of EPA and DHA and associated oxylipins, including 18-HEPE, RvE2, 14-HDHA in white adipose tissue (WAT) and liver. Simultaneously, KrO decreased arachidonic acid (ARA) concentrations and ARA-derived oxylipins (e.g. HETEs, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, TXB2). In epididymal WAT (eWAT), KrO activated regulators of adipogenesis (e.g. PPARγ, CEBPα, KLF15, STAT5A), induced a shift towards smaller adipocytes and increased total adipocyte numbers indicative for hyperplasia. KrO reduced crown-like structures in eWAT, and suppressed HFD-stimulated inflammatory pathways including TNFα and CCL2/MCP-1 signaling. The ob-served changes in eWAT were accompanied by reduced leptin and increased adiponectin levels over time, and an improvement in insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In liver, KrO suppressed in-flammatory signaling pathways including those controlled by IL-1β and M-CSF, without affecting liver histology. Furthermore, KrO deactivated hepatic REL-A/p65-NF-κB signaling, consistent with increased PPARα protein expression and a trend increase in IkBα. In conclusion, long-term KrO treatment increased several anti-inflammatory PUFAs and oxylipins in WAT and liver. These changes were accompanied by beneficial effects on general metabolism and inflammatory tone at tissue level. Stimulation of adipogenesis by KrO allows for safe fat storage and may, together with more direct PPAR-mediated anti-inflammatory mechanisms, attenuate inflammation.

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms controlling metastatic processes remains essential to improve the success of targeted therapies. The Rac1/Cdc42 regulator CdGAP (Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein) has been implicated in fundamental cellular processes involved during cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate that elevated CdGAP expression is associated with early biochemical relapse (BCR) and bone metastasis in PCa patients. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of CdGAP in PCa data sets revealed a positive association between high CdGAP expression and early BCR. CdGAP protein and mRNA levels were elevated in PC-3 cells with high metastatic potential compared to low levels of CdGAP in the androgen receptor positive LNCaP cell line. Knockdown of CdGAP in PC-3 cells reduced cell motility, invasion, proliferation and colony-formation ability while inducing an increase in cell apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of CdGAP in DU-145 cells increased cell migration and invasion. Using global gene expression approaches we found that CdGAP regulates the expression of genes involved in EMT, apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Subcutaneous injection of CdGAP-depleted PC-3 cells into mice showed a delayed tumor initiation and attenuated tumor growth. Orthotopic prostate injection of CdGAP-depleted PC-3 cells reduced cancer metastasis to kidneys, bones, and testis. Collectively, these findings support a pro-oncogenic role of CdGAP in prostate tumorigenesis and unveil CdGAP as a novel biomarker and potential target for prostate cancer treatments.		shCONTROL;shCDGAP;PC-3 prostate cancer cells

Macrophage inflammatory status (polarization) is regulated by its metabolic state, but to date, little is understood of macrophage metabolism and its relation to macrophage polarization in the context of muscle recovery and aging. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to thoroughly characterize macrophage metabolism and polarization in aged muscle during early recovery from disuse atrophy using single cell RNA sequencing and functional assays. Young (4-5 mo) and old (20-22 mo) male C57BL/6 mice underwent 14 days of hindlimb unloading followed by 4 days of ambulatory recovery. CD45+ cells were isolated from solei muscles and analyzed using 10x Genomics single cell RNA sequencing. We found that aged M1 macrophage clusters were characterized with an impaired inflammatory and glycolytic transcriptome and this impairment was accompanied by a suppression of HIF-1α and its immediate downstream target GLUT1.		old (20-22 mo);Young (4-5 mo);Hindlimb Unloading;CD45+ Cells From FACS;Reloading (4 Day);Skeletal Muscle (Soleus);C57BL/6;male;Ambulatory Control

The proL1 overexpressing variant (LNCaP proL1+) and their parental cell line were plated in 6-well plates in triplicate (3 wells for each cell line). After 3 days, their RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit and their global gene expression patterns were analyzed using RNA-Seq Results: We identified 1110 differentially expressed genes between LNCaP proL1+ and its parental cell line. Of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 209 were in common with PC3 when proL1 was overexpressed. To identify biological functions that may be regulated through overexpression of proL1 in LNCaP cells, the list of DEGs was submitted to the DAVID, GOC, and KEGG databases. According to these databases, proL1 overexpression regulated gene expression in ontological groups involved in morphogenesis and signal transduction. DEGs were also overrepresented in ontological groups potentially involved in vascularization and blood flow regulation. However, there were differences in the regulation of specific genes related to the androgen response between LNCaP and PC3. Unlike PC3, where overexpression of ProL1 caused a significant increase in expression of the androgen receptor gene (AR) and a decrease in expression of the estrogen receptor (ESR1), in LNCaP neither of these genes were changed in expression. In contrast, proL1 overexpression in LNCaP reduced expression of the progesterone receptor gene (PGR) but not in PC3 cells. Conclusion: Global analysis of the changes in gene expression caused by proL1 overexpression in PC3 and LNCaP cells supports that it has a role both in the modulation of genetic pathways involved in both overcoming hypoxia and the development of androgen-insensitivity. Opiorphins have previously been shown to be directly involved in regulation of blood-flow to tissues through their modulation of smooth muscle tone, and therefore their upregulation in tumors may directly contribute to overcoming the hypoxic barrier that develops in the growing tumor. In addition, overexpression of ProL1 in both PC3 and LNCaP cells modulated expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and morphogensis; the activation of these pathways would likely be involved in vascularization of the tumor and thereby also contribute to overcoming hypoxia. Overexpression of proL1 also affected genes involved in steroid metabolism and response pathways in both LNCaP and PC3, which could potentially contribute to the modulation of androgen sensitivity. For example, overexpression of ProL1 in LNCaP reduced expression of the progesterone receptor gene (PGR). Activation of PGR is a positive modulator of cell division and the reduced expression of PGR in LNCaP proL1 cells might therefore explain the negative effect on tumor growth in female mice. Overall, our data associates the development of PrCa with overexpression of opiorphin and suggests genetic pathways by which they contribute to tumor growth and development of androgen-insensitivity.

To better understand the regulation of HIV in macrophages, we compared HIV infected human monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) to acutely infected primary CD4 T cells and Jurkat cell lines latently infected with HIV (JLAT). HIV genomes in MDM were actively transcribed despite enrichment with heterochromatin-associated H3K9me3 across the complete HIV genome in combination with elevated activation marks of H3K9ac and H3K27ac at the LTR. In contrast, JLAT showed conventional bivalent H3K4me3/H3K27me3 while CD4 showed an intermediate epigenotype. 5‘-methylcytosine (5mC) was enriched across the HIV genome in latently infected JLAT cells, while 5‘-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc) was enriched in CD4 and MDM. HIV infection induced multinucleation of MDMs along with DNA damage associate p53 phosphorylation, as well as loss of TET2 and the nuclear redistribution of 5-hydoxymethylation. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that MDMs have a distinct transcriptional response to HIV persistent infection, including activation of CCL7, LAG3, and interferon signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that HIV induces a unique macrophage nuclear and transcriptional profile, and viral genomes are maintained in a non-canonical bivalent epigenetic state.

However, how this transcriptional mechanism modulates gene expression programs in adult tissues is largely unknown. Here, we released paused RNA Pol II by depleting Rn7sk during mouse and human epidermal stem cell differentiation. Unexpectedly, the forced release of transcription robustly repressed RNA levels including numerous cell cycle regulators leading to cell cycle exit and differentiation. The repression of genes occurred in the absence of chromatin remodelling at promoters and enhancers. Instead, it was caused by splicing defects and co-transcriptional RNA degradation. However, rather than acting globally, Rn7sk modulated transcription gene-specifically. Genes that required Rn7sk for efficient transcription contained highly accessible promoters, lower guanosine and cytosine (GC) content, shorter introns, and weaker 3’ splice sites. In the absence of a tightly controlled Pol II pause release complex, these intrinsic gene properties cumulated in impaired splicing leading to RNA decay. Thus, 7SK-regulated transcriptional pausing is an essential step to coordinate transcription with splicing to permit productive transcription of a distinct set of genes.		no;Control;4h;Rn7sk;DMSO;1h;Keratinocytes;Pladienolide B;human primary keratinocytes

However, how this interruption of transcription is mechanistically linked to RNA production remains largely unknown. Here, we show that forcing the pause release by germ-line deletion of Rn7sk was embryonic lethal, yet conditional deletion of Rn7sk enhanced stem cell differentiation in skin. To explore the immediate transcriptional mechanisms underpinning enhanced differentiation, we metabolically labelled newly-synthesized RNAs after Rn7sk deletion. Unexpectedly, forced pause release robustly repressed transcription specifically at cell cycle regulators, in the absence of chromatin remodeling at promoters and enhancers. Our results indicate that polymerase pausing affords the core elongation machinery time to properly assemble, and forced elongation triggers splicing defects and nuclear RNA decay. Cell cycle regulators appear highly sensitive to mis-regulation of the elongation machinery due to unique genomic features of high promoter accessibility and low GC–content in the gene body. Transcriptional pausing thus serves as a rate-limiting step in controlling cell division.		Neonatal;48h;24h;Human primary keratinocytes

We report very rare, biochemically deleterious X-linked TLR7 variants in 16 unrelated male individuals aged 7 to 71 years (mean: 36.7 years) from a cohort of 1,202 male patients aged 0.5 to 99 years (mean: 52.9 years) with unexplained critical COVID-19 pneumonia. None of the 331 asymptomatically or mildly infected male individuals aged 1.3 to 102 years (mean: 38.7 years) tested carry such TLR7 variants (p = 3.5 x 10-5). The phenotypes of five hemizygous relatives of index cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 include asymptomatic or mild infection (n=2, 5 and 38 years), or moderate (n=1, 5 years), severe (n=1, 27 years), or critical (n=1, 29 years) pneumonia. Two boys (aged 7 and 12 years) from a cohort of 262 male patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (mean: 51.0 years) are hemizygous for a deleterious TLR7 variant. The cumulative allele frequency for deleterious TLR7 variants in the male general population is < 6.5x10-4. We also show that blood B-cell lines and myeloid cell subsets from the patients do not respond to TLR7 stimulation, a phenotype rescued by wild-type TLR7. The patients’ blood plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce low levels of type I IFNs in response to SARS-CoV-2. Overall, X-linked recessive TLR7 deficiency is a highly penetrant genetic etiology of critical COVID-19 pneumonia, in about 1.8% of male patients below the age of 60 years.

Methods:NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Sigma), 50U/ml Penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco,cat.no.15070) at 37℃ with 5% CO2. Cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin solution (HyClone, No.SH42605.01) when they reached ~106 cells/ml. Then, the cells were washed with 1X PBS, and then mixed with 1ml TRIzol solution (ThermoFish, No.15596029), and snap-frozen with dry ice. Total RNA was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated as follows: (1) the RNA sample was initially qualitatively evaluated using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis for possible contamination and degradation; (2) RNA purity and concentration were then examined using NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer; (3) RNA integrity and quantity were finally measured using RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system. After library preparation and pooling of different samples, the samples were subjected to Illumina sequencing. The libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Platform for 6G raw data and generated 150nt pair-end reads. UMI sequences on each read were identified by UMI-tools (1.0.0), and reads with UMIs were used for the subsequent analysis. To identify the duplicated reads, UMIs were initially removed from the UMI reads, and the remaining parts of each read were mapped to the reference genome using Hisat2. Reads that mapped to the same location on the reference genome were identified as duplicated reads. Then, the UMIs on each read were recalled, and the duplicated reads with the same UMI were identified as non-natural duplications, which were subsequently removed from the processed data. HTSeq v0.6.1 was used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene. Then, the FPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene, and the read count was mapped to the gene.

Recent studies identified SLC4A4 (a gene encoding an electrogenic Na+-coupled HCO3- cotransporter and intracellular pH regulator, NBCe1) as one of the mis-expressed genes in beta cells of patients with T2DM. Thus, in the current study we set out to test the hypothesis that mis-expression of SLC4A4/NBCe1 in T2DM beta cells contributes to beta cell dysfunction and impaired glucose homeostasis. To address this hypothesis, we first confirmed induction of SLC4A4/NBCe1 expression in beta cells of patients with T2DM and demonstrated that its expression is associated with loss of beta cell transcriptional identity, intracellular alkalinization, and beta cell dysfunction. In addition, we generated a beta cell selective Slc4a4/NBCe1 knockout mouse model and report that these mice are protected from diet-induced metabolic stress and beta cell failure. Importantly, improved glucose tolerance and enhanced beta cell function in Slc4a4/NBCe1 deficient mice was due to augmented mitochondrial function and increased expression of genes regulating beta cell identity and function. These results suggest that increased beta cell expression of SLC4A4/NBCe1 in T2DM plays a contributory role in promotion of beta cell failure and should be considered as a potential novel therapeutic target.		20 weeks;b-Slc4a4+/+;8 weeks 60% high fat diet;Pancreatic islets;Islet;b-Slc4a4-/-;C57BL/6

Here, we show that irisin, the cleaved and circulating form of the exercise-induced membrane protein FNDC5, is sufficient to confer the exercise benefits on cognitive function. Genetic deletion of FNDC5/irisin (global F5KO mice) impairs cognitive function in exercise, aging, and AD. Diminished pattern separation in F5KOs can be rescued by delivering irisin directly into the dentate gyrus, suggesting that irisin is the active moiety. In F5KOs, adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus are morphologically, transcriptionally, and functionally abnormal.

We used SCA-3 84Q transgenic mice as a disease model to study the therapeutic effect of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles were established and compared between the control (15Q), disease(84Q) and treatment(84Q+IGF-1) groups using RNA-seq and metabolic network analysis. SCA3-84Q mice showed a decrease in glycolysis, lipolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and an increase in apoptosis, and IGF-1 treatment reversed the alterations slightly.

Recent reports have described first trimester EVT as polyploid and senescent. Here we extend these earlier reports by performing comprehensive profiling of the genomic organization and transcriptome of first trimester EVT and term EVT. We define pathways and gene regulatory networks involved in both initial differentiation and maturation of this important trophoblast lineage at the maternal-fetal interface. Our results suggest that like first trimester EVT, term EVT undergo senescence and endoreduplication, are primarily tetraploid, and lack high rates of copy number variations. Additionally, we have highlighted senescence and polyploidy-related genes, pathways, networks, and transcription factors that appeared to be important in normal EVT differentiation and maturation and have validated a critical role for the unfolded protein response in EVT differentiation.		cytotrophoblast;extravillous_trophoblast_cells_isolated_from_placenta;Female;Male;extravillous trophoblast;cytotrophoblast_cells_isolated_from_placenta

A previously reported homozygous deletion in the Man1a2 gene causes lethal respiratory failure in newborn pups and decreased lung ciliation compared with wild type (WT) pups. The effects of heterozygous mutation, and the potential for rescue are not known. Purpose: We hypothesized that survival and lung ciliation a) would decrease progressively in Man1a2 +/- heterozygous and Man1a2 -/- null newborn pups compared with WT, and b) could be enhanced by gestational treatment with N-Acetyl-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant. Methods: Man1a2 +/- adult mice were fed NAC or placebo from a week before breeding through gestation. Survival of newborn pups was monitored for 24 hours. Lungs, liver and tails were harvested for morphology, genotyping and transcriptional profiling. Results: Survival (p=0.0001, Kaplan-Meier) and percent lung ciliation (p=0.0001, ANOVA) measured by frequency of Arl13b+ respiratory epithelial cells decreased progressively, as hypothesized. Compared with placebo, gestational NAC treatment enhanced a) lung ciliation in pups with each genotype, b) survival in heterozygous pups (p=0.017) but not in WT or null pups. Whole transcriptome of lung but not liver demonstrated patterns of up- and down-regulated genes that were identical in living heterozygous and WT pups, and completely opposite to those in dead heterozygous and null pups. Systems biology analysis enabled reconstruction of protein interaction networks that yielded functionally relevant modules and their interactions. In these networks, the mutant Man1a2 enzyme contributes to abnormal synthesis of proteins essential for lung development. The associated unfolded protein, hypoxic and oxidative stress responses can be mitigated with NAC. Comparisons with the developing human fetal lung transcriptome show that NAC likely restores normal vascular and epithelial tube morphogenesis in Man1a2 mutant mice. Conclusions: Survival and lung ciliation in the Man1a2 mutant mouse, and its improvement with N-Acetyl cysteine is genotype-dependent. NAC-mediated rescue depends on the central role for oxidative and hypoxic stress in regulating ciliary function and organogenesis during development		lung;N-acetyl cysteine (NAC);liver;Man1a2 Het mutant;C57BL/6J;Man1a2 null mutant;Wild-type;placebo

Ypel4, one of five YPEL family gene orthologs in mouse and human, is highly and specifically expressed in late terminal erythroid differentiation. In this study, we investigated the role of Ypel4 in murine erythropoiesis, providing for the first time an in-depth description of a Ypel4-null phenotype in vivo. We demonstrated that the Ypel4-null mice displayed a secondary polycythemia with macro- and reticulocytosis. While lack of Ypel4 did not affect steady-state erythropoiesis in the bone marrow or spleen, the anemia-recovering capacity of Ypel4-null cells was diminished. Furthermore, Ypel4-null red blood cells (RBC) were cleared from the circulation at an increased rate, demonstrating an intrinsic defect of RBCs. Scanning electron micrographs revealed an ovalocytic morphology of Ypel4-null RBCs and functional testing confirmed reduced deformability. Even though Band 3 protein levels were shown to be reduced in Ypel4-null RBC membranes, we could not find support for a physical interaction between YPEL4 and the Band 3 protein. In conclusion, our findings provide crucial insights into the role of Ypel4 in preserving normal red cell membrane functionality.

However, among survivors up to 95% experience permanent disabilities: post-SAH syndrome, which include impaired memory, executive functions, emotional and cognitive disturbances. Up to 45% of SAH patients are unable to continue with their professional activities. The long-term cognitive deficits result from morphological brain damage, including atrophy of the temporomesial/hippocampal area, which correlates with decreased neurocognitive scores. The mechanisms of the remote brain damage following SAH remain unknown, which hinders the progress in identifying new therapeutic targets. To unveil the leading mechanisms of permanent cognitive abnormalities following SAH and origin of atrophy of the temporomesial/hippocampal area, we analyzed SAH-induced specific hippocampal genomic pathways, which may lead to long term morphological damage. methods: Hippocampal RNA of SAH and Control groups, obtained 4 days after SAH induced by perforation of the circle of Willis in mice, was processed and sequenced. Using the next-generation RNA sequencing we determined differentially expressed genes in the bilateral whole hippocampus remote from SAH and applied different functional analyses and clustering tools to determine the main molecular pathways. Results: Differential gene expression analysis detected 642 upregulated and 398 down-regulated genes (false discovery rate <0.10) in SAH compared to Control group. Functional analyses using IPA suite, Gene Ontology terms, REACTOME pathways, and MsigDB Hallmark gene set collections revealed suppression of oligodendrocytes/myelin related genes, and overexpression of genes related to complement system along with genes related to innate and adaptive immunity, and extracellular matrix reorganization. Interferon regulatory factors, TGF-β1 and BMP, were identified as major orchestrating elements in the hippocampal tissue response. The MEME-Suite identified binding motifs of Krüppel-like factors, zinc finger transcription factors, and interferon regulatory factors as overrepresented DNA promoter motifs. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that damage of the entorhinal cortex by the subarachnoid blood remotely triggers specific hippocampal response, which may include suppression of oligodendrocytes functioning due to anterograde degeneration of hippocampal afferents accompanied. Identification of the prominent molecular hippocampal pathways may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of long-term SAH consequences.		sham;subarachnoid hemorrhage;whole bilateral hippocampus;naive

Many patients suffer from adverse drug effects during treatment and other complications later in life, and would benefit from improved relapse prediction at diagnosis. We performed whole genome sequencing of samples collected at diagnosis, relapse(s) and remission from 29 Nordic patients with pediatric ALL. Somatic mutations were called using individually matched remission samples as controls, and allelic expression of the mutations in the ALL cells was assessed using RNA-sequencing. These analyses identified 29 previously known ALL driver genes, of which nine genes carried recurrent protein-coding mutations in our sample set, and 20 mutated driver genes occurred in individual samples. We detected putative non-coding mutations in regulatory regions of seven additional genes that have not been described previously in ALL. We observed an increased burden of somatic mutations at relapse. Cluster analysis of hundreds of somatic mutations per sample revealed three distinct evolutionary trajectories during ALL progression. In an “ancestral clone trajectory”, the major cell clone at relapse originated from a founder clone that was not detectable at diagnosis. In a “rising diagnostic clone trajectory”, a minor cell clone at diagnosis expanded to form the major cell clone at relapse. In a “persistent diagnostic clone trajectory”, the major cell clone at diagnosis persisted during treatment until relapse. The evolutionary trajectories provide insight into the mutational mechanisms leading relapse in ALL and could offer biomarkers for improved risk prediction in individual patients.

They act via the GC receptor GR (encoded by the Nr3c1 gene). Their role is to control metabolic pathways, and to limit inflammation. The latter is often compromised, by unknown mechanisms, in severe inflammatory conditions. We here investigated the in vivo impact of hypoxia on GR function in mice, by genome wide analysis in liver and by means of deep hypoxia. Our data reveal that hypoxia leads to profound reductions in transcriptional output of GR, when stimulated with dexamethasone, leading to absent induction of genes with anti-inflammatory functions such as Tsc22d3 and Dusp1 in liver and other organs. Hypoxia also activates the entire HPA axis, by HIF1α and HIF2α activation in hypothalamus, causing long-term corticosterone production by adrenals. The latter leads to lipolysis in adipose tissue, followed by β-oxidation and ketogenesis in liver, but also to the reprogramming of GR, whereby GR limits its anti-inflammatory functions. These genome-wide RNAseq and ChIPSeq data, accompanied with studies using GR inhibitor, GR mutant mice and adrenalectomized animals suggest that hypoxia leads to increased sensitivity for acute inflammation and lack of protection by dexamethasone, due to the chronic HPA axis stimulation.

Because obesity is a major risk factor in the development of ccRCC, we investigated the role of the adipokines in driving lipid metabolism and tumorigenesis in ccRCC. Through in silico screening, we identified the adipokine chemerin as candidate pro-oncogenic factor that is overexpressed in tumors and prognostic for patient outcome. Both ccRCC patient tumor tissues and serum exhibit elevated chemerin levels as compared to normal controls in an obesity-dependent manner. Attenuation of chemerin by several approaches in ccRCC cells led to significant impairments of tumor growth in both in vitro and in vivo models. A multi-omic approach revealed that chemerin suppresses fatty acid oxidation and maintains fatty acid levels which feed into transcriptional activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2 (HIF2) expression. Suppression of chemerin therefore induced excess fatty acid oxidation and led to ferroptosis. CoQ and mitochondrial complex IV, derived mainly from lipid, were affected after chemerin inhibition, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid reactive oxygen species production. Monoclonal antibody targeting chemerin led to reduced lipid storage, increased cell death, and diminished tumor growth, strengthening the translational potential of chemerin inhibition. Collectively, the results suggest that obesity and tumor cells contribute to ccRCC through the expression of chemerin, which is indispensable in ccRCC biology.		shGFP control;shRARRES2_1 knockdown;Clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell line;shRARRES2_2 knockdown;Clear cell renal cell carcinoma;shRARRES2_3 knockdown

Stereotypies are also evoked by psychomotor stimulants such as amphetamine. The acquisition of motor sequences are paralleled by changes in activity patterns in the striatum, and stereotypies have been linked to abnormal plasticity in these reinforcement-related circuits. Here, we designed experiments in mice to identify transcriptomic changes that underlie striatal plasticity occurring alongside the development of drug-induced stereotypic behavior. We identified three schedules of amphetamine treatment inducing different degrees of stereotypy and used bulk RNAseq to compare striatal gene expression changes among groups of mice treated with the different drug-dose schedules and vehicle-treated, cage-mate controls. Mice were identified as naive, sensitized, or tolerant to drug-induced stereotypy. All drug-treated groups exhibited expression changes in genes that encode members of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades known to regulate psychomotor stimulant responses. In the sensitized group with the most prolonged stereotypy, we found dysregulation of 20 genes that were not changed in other groups. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated highly significant overlap with genes regulated by neuregulin 1 (Nrg1). Nrg1 is known to be a schizophrenia and autism susceptibility gene that encodes a ligand for Erb-B receptors, which are involved in neuronal migration, myelination and cell survival, including that of dopamine-containing neurons. Stimulant abuse is a risk factor for schizophrenia onset, and these two disorders share behavioral stereotypy phenotypes. Our results raise the possibility that drug-induced sensitization of the Nrg1 signaling pathway might underlie these links.

ER stress response is mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE1α endoribonuclease and its substrate XBP1 to regulate XBP1 target gene expression. However, the mechanism that controls the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway remains poorly understood. CARM1 is an oncogene that is often overexpressed in a number of cancer types including ovarian cancer. Here we report that CARM1 determines ER stress response by controlling the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway. Genome-wide profiling revealed that CARM1 regulates XBP1 target gene expression during ER stress response. CARM1 directly interacts with XBP1. Inhibition of the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway was effective in ovarian cancer in a CARM1-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo in orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft models. In addition, IRE1α inhibitor B-I09 synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade anti-PD1 antibody in an immunocompetent CARM1-expressing ovarian cancer model.

However, the characteristics and contributions of CEBPs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is unknown. Here, we showed that most of CEBPs (including CEBPA, CEBPB, CEBPE, CEBPG, CEBPZ) were upregulated and amplified in ESCC. Of note, high CEBPG expression is a prognostic factor for the poor survival of patients with ESCC. Moreover, the ESCC specific transcription factor TP63 activates the expression of CEBPG by directly binding to its distal enhancer. Functionally, CEBPG significantly enhances the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CEBPG enhances the PI3K-AKT signaling pathways through directly binding to distal enhancer or/and promoter of downstream target genes, such as CCND1, MYC and CDK2 etc. These findings provide important characteristics and contributions insights into CEBPs dysregulation in ESCC and elucidate a crucial role for CEBPG in the progression of ESCC, which highlights its potential therapeutic target for patients.

As HIF2α is the driver of the disease promoting tumour growth and metastasis, drugs targeting HIF2α have been developed. However, resistance is common, therefore new therapies are needed. Methods: we generated the 786-0 HIF2α knockout (KO) cell line and assessed the HIF2α antagonist PT2385 in several steps of tumour development. RNA sequencing was performed to identify genes differentially expressed between them and a drug screening was used to identify drugs with differential effects on HIF2α-expressing and KO cells. Results: HIF2α KO promoted cell migration, reduced proliferation and clonogenicity, as well as metastasis, whereas PT2385 treatment only inhibited tumour cell invasion. There was a large set of co-ordinately regulated genes, but HIF2α KO cells also had up-regulation of genes related to EMT and downregulation of genes involving cell migration and extracellular matrix. The HIF2α KO increased sensitivity to statins, while PT2385 had no effect. Conclusions: this study shows new pathways that could be targeted combined with PT2385 to enhance its therapeutic effects and delay resistance.		clear cell renal cell carcinoma;hif2a KO;786-0 cells;786-0;WT

However, the roles of 3D epigenome in pancreatic cancer biology, especially its metastasis, remain unclear. Here we compare the 3D epigenomic and transcriptomic features among cells derived from pancreatic epithelial, primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer by integrated analysis of in situ Hi-C, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq data. We found A/B compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), chromatin loops changed significantly in metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, which is associated with epigenetic state alterations. Moreover, we identified upregulated genes, which are located in switched compartments, common TADs with epigenetic state changing, specific TAD boundaries, and metastasis-specific enhancer-promoter loops, are related to cancer metastasis. We also find that the transcription factors mediated specific enhancer-promoter loops formation are also associated with metastasis. Taken together, these results provide a 3D epigenomic map of pancreatic cancer metastasis, which expands our knowledge of the epigenetic mechanism of pancreatic cancer metastasis and enables a better understanding of pancreatic cancer pathobiology.

However, it is still not completely understood how c-Myc functions in GC. Here, we generated a stomach-specific c-Myc knock-in mouse model to investigate its role in GC. We found that overexpression of c-Myc in Atp4b+ gastric parietal cells could induce intestinal-type gastric cancer in mice. Mechanistically, c-Myc promoted tumorigenesis via the AKT/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, AKT inhibitor (MK-2206) or mTOR inhibitor (Rapamycin) inhibited the proliferation of c-Myc overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines.

Hepatic synthesis of GABA, catalyzed by GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), is upregulated in obese mice. To assess the role of hepatic GABA production in obesity-induced metabolic and energy dysregulation, we treated mice with two pharmacologic GABA-T inhibitors and also knocked down hepatic GABA-T expression using an antisense oligonucleotide. Hepatic GABA-T inhibition and knockdown decreased basal hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, and improved glucose intolerance. GABA-T knockdown improved insulin sensitivity assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in obese mice. Hepatic GABA-T knockdown also decreased food intake and induced weight loss without altering energy expenditure in obese mice. Data from obese humans support that hepatic GABA production and transport are associated with serum insulin, HOMA-IR, T2D, and BMI. These results support a key role for hepatocyte GABA production in the dysfunctional glucoregulation and feeding behavior associated with obesity.		Liver;Female;Male;obese

Using a mouse model that very closely mimics what is seen in APECED patients, oral epithelial cells were sorted and RNA extracted from them to perform RNA-seq analysis to determine what other pathways may be involved.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive tumor that has a low overall survival; however, no significant treatment advances have been made in the past 15 years. In this study we investigated whether targeting lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1), a histone-modifying enzyme responsible for demethylating histone H3 lysine 4 and lysine 9, could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with MPM. We found that suppressing LSD1 induces an epithelial phenotype in sarcomatoid MPM cells, while attenuating the mesenchymal phenotype sensitized MPM cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis through the FAK pathway. To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying FAK pathway activation, we performed transcriptome analysis using two different shRNA constructs against the LSD1.

Cytogenetic changes are recurrent within malignant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, yet their role in anemia pathogenesis remains unknown. One recurrent karyotypic abnormality in myeloid neoplasms is the deletion of part or all of chromosome 7 [-7/del(7q)], which harbors the transcription factor and tumor suppressor gene, CUX1. CUX1 knockdown mouse models develop myeloid disease similar to that seen in humans, including a spontaneous, cell intrinsic, and lethal anemia that develops with age. Here, we elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CUX1 regulates erythropoiesis. We demonstrate CUX1 knockdown mice have an aberrant stress erythropoiesis response and decreased survival after acute anemia induction. CUX1 insufficient erythroblasts undergo accelerated cell cycling and increased apoptosis. In line with these phenotypes, transcriptome profiling indicates that CUX1-knockdown elicits increased proliferation and decreased erythroid differentiation gene signatures. ATAC-sequencing demonstrated dramatic, global chromatin opening in CUX1-knockdown erythroblasts. As measured by fluorescence lifetime imaging, this increased chromatin accessibility is concomitant with a disruption in nuclear condensation, which is normally requisite in mammalian erythroblasts for nuclear eviction and terminal differentiation. Finally, we show that CUX1 mediates chromatin compaction by promoting histone deacetylation. Thus, rather than a transcriptional role, our data implicate in an epigenetic regulatory role for CUX1 in erythropoiesis. Furthermore, these results suggest therapeutic targeting of epigenetic regulators, such as histone acetyl transferases, may have clinical benefit for the anemias associated with loss of CUX1.

ABHD2 has been shown to regulate ion channel activation in human sperm cells by breaking down the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol in the cell membrane(Miller et al., 2016). However, CPECs isolated from global Abhd2 knockout mice that were generated in our lab(Ida Björkgren, 2019) showed similar expression and activation of Kir7.1 as cells from wild type animals, thus negating any possible effect of the receptor on Kir7.1 activation.		hoz;F;Choroid Plexus;M;wt;C57BL6

Finally, B-I09 synergizes with inhibition of HDAC6, a known regulator of the ER stress response, in suppressing the growth of ARID1A-inactivated OCCCs. These studies reveal a promising therapeutic strategy for ARID1A-mutant OCCCs and define the IRE1?-XBP1 axis of the ER stress response as a targetable vulnerability for ARID1A-mutant OCCCs. Our findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition of the IRE1?-XBP1 pathway alone or in combination with HDAC6 inhibition represents an urgently needed therapeutic strategy for ARID1A-mutant ovarian cancers.		ctr;KO;TM;RMG1 cell line;WT
GSE179023	2021.08.10	Mus musculus	GPL23479	TRUE	FALSE	36	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE		34407998	RNA-sequencing reveals niche gene expression effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate in primary myotubes	Various forms of fasting, including time-restricted feeding, alternate day fasting, and periodic fasting have shown promise in clinical and pre-clinical studies to normalize body weight, improve metabolic health, and protect against disease. Recent studies suggest that β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), a characteristic ketone body of the fasted metabolic state, acts as a potential signaling molecule mediating the beneficial effects of the various forms of fasting, potentially by acting as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. In the first part we investigated whether βOHB, in comparison to the well-established histone deacetylase inhibitor butyrate, influences cellular differentiation in vitro. In C2C12 myotubes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and THP-1 monocytes, millimolar concentrations of βOHB did not alter differentiation, as determined by gene expression and histological assessment, whereas equimolar concentrations of butyrate potently impaired differentiation in all cell types. RNA-sequencing revealed that unlike butyrate, βOHB minimally impacted gene expression in adipocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes. However, in myocytes, βOHB upregulated genes involved in the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, while downregulating genes belonging to cytokine and chemokine signal transduction. Overall, our data do not support the notion that βOHB serves as a powerful signaling molecule regulating gene expression in adipocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes, but suggest that βOHB may act as a niche signaling molecule in muscle.		control (PBS);primary mouse adipocytes, treated with vehicle (PBS) for 6 hrs;5 mM NaB [butyric acid sodium salt];primary hepatocytes;primary mouse macrophages, treated with β-hydroxybutyric acid (bOHB; 5mM) for 6 hrs;primary mouse skeletal myotubes, treated with vehicle (PBS) for 6 hrs;primary adipocytes;primary macrophages;primary mouse adipocytes, treated with butyric acid (bOHB; 5mM) for 6 hrs;primary mouse skeletal myotubes, treated with butyric acid (bOHB; 5mM) for 6 hrs;primary mouse hepatocytes, treated with vehicle (PBS) for 6 hrs;5 mM bOHB [(R)-(–)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid sodium salt];primary mouse skeletal myotubes, treated with β-hydroxybutyric acid (bOHB; 5mM) for 6 hrs;primary mouse hepatocytes, treated with β-hydroxybutyric acid (bOHB; 5mM) for 6 hrs;C57Bl/6;primary mouse macrophages, treated with vehicle (PBS) for 6 hrs;primary mouse adipocytes, treated with β-hydroxybutyric acid (bOHB; 5mM) for 6 hrs;primary skeletal myotubes;primary mouse macrophages, treated with butyric acid (bOHB; 5mM) for 6 hrs;primary mouse hepatocytes, treated with butyric acid (bOHB; 5mM) for 6 hrs;6 hrs

In this study we aimed to set up and validate a novel non-invasive processing-free method for RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of spontaneous sputum samples collected from COPD patients. Methods: Spontaneous sputum samples were collected and stabilized, with or without selection of plugs and with or without the use of a stabilizer specifically formulated for downstream diagnostic testing (PrimeStore® Molecular Transport Medium). After 8-day storage at ambient temperature RNA was isolated according to an optimized RNAzol® method. An average percentage of fragments longer than 200 nucleotides (DV200) >30% and an individual yield >50ng were required for progression of samples to sequencing. Finally, to assess if the transcriptome generated would reflect a true endotype of COPD inflammation, the outcome of single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was validated using an independent set of processed induced sputum samples Results: RNA extracted from spontaneous sputum using a stabilizer showed an average DV200 higher than 30%. 70% of the samples had a yield >50ng and were submitted to downstream analysis. There was a straightforward correlation in terms of gene expression between samples handled with or without separation of plugs. This was also confirmed by principal component analysis and ssGSEA. The top ten enriched pathways resulting from spontaneous sputum ssGSEA were associated to features of COPD, namely, inflammation, immune responses and oxidative stress; up to 70% of these were in common within the top ten enriched pathways resulting from induced sputum ssGSEA. Conclusion: This analysis confirmed that the typical COPD endotype was represented within spontaneous sputum and supported the current method as a non-invasive processing-free procedure to assess the level of sputum cell inflammation in COPD patients by RNAseq analysis.		spontaneous sputum;Sputum;COPD

Methods: Retinal mRNA profiles of C57BL/6J mice after 6 different hypoxic exposures were generated by deep sequencing (n=6) using paired-end high output sequencing (Illumina Novaseq 6000). Results: Longitudinal studies over 11 weeks in normobaric hypoxia revealed four classes of genes that adapted differentially to the long-term hypoxic condition. Many differentially expressed genes were involved in the regulation of gene expression. Seventeen genes were specifically regulated in hypobaric hypoxia. Some of these genes may affect the structural integrity of the retina or individual cells, resulting in the slight shortening of photoreceptor segment length detected in various hypoxic groups.		7w;hypoxia;6h;48h;11w;Retina;C57BL/6J;normoxia;Zurich (400masl);Jungfraujoch (3450masl)

Further KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that 27 significant signaling pathways, including metabolism, immune inflammation regulation, cell function regulation, cancer and myocardial disease, pathogen infection, were affected by VACV infection. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation indicated that these genes were mainly enriched on cell level regulation, immunological processes, protein levels, and signal transduction pathway.

A rat model of NAFLD was established by feeding male rats with high-fat diet and Agilent DNA microarray was used to detect gene expression profiles of liver tissues. We explored differentially expressed genes and intersection of them by using Gene ontology (GO) and Pathway analyses. Then, target genes were verified by Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). There were 932 genes, including 783 up-regulated and 149 down-regulated, differed in expression compared to those of control rats. The up-regulated genes were involved in biosynthesis, cell development, cell differentiation and down-regulated genes mainly contributed to biological metabolic process and stress reaction. We identified genes involved in insulin signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, adipocytokin and linoleic acid metabolism to be closely related to liver fat content and insulin resistance. Among them, genes which supposed to connect glucose and lipid metabolism were screened (IGFBP7, Notch1, HMGCR and ACACB) and then validated by real-time PCR. These data provide innovative information on the whole genome expression profile due to high-fat diet feeding and bring important insights into the mechanism of NAFLD.

The sympathetic nervous system regulates glucagon secretion. To investigate islet sympathetic innervation in T1D, sympathetic tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) axons were analyzed in control non-diabetic organ donors, non-diabetic islet autoantibody-positive individuals (AAb), and age-matched persons with T1D. Islet TH axon numbers and density were significantly decreased in AAb compared to T1D with no significant differences observed in exocrine TH axon volume or lengths between groups. TH axons were in close approximation to islet α-cells in T1D individuals with long-standing diabetes. Islet RNA-sequencing and qRT-PCR analyses identified significant alterations in noradrenalin degradation, α-adrenergic signaling, cardiac b-adrenergic signaling, catecholamine biosynthesis, and additional neuropathology pathways. The close approximation of TH axons at islet α-cells supports a model for sympathetic efferent neurons directly regulating glucagon secretion. Sympathetic islet innervation and intrinsic adrenergic signaling pathways could be novel targets for improving glucagon secretion in T1D.		non-diabetic islet autoantibody-positive individuals;diabetic;laser microdissected islets;control non-diabetic

Surprisingly, the administration of recombinant CLCF1 repressed excessive bone loss in ovariectomized mice and reduced the levels of local osteolytic lesions induced by a RANKL injection. Likewise, the addition of recombinant CLCF1 to RANKL-stimulated monocytes resulted in a significant suppression in the number of differentiated osteoclasts and their resorption activity on dentine slices.		macrophage stimulated by RANKL and CLCF1;stimulated by RANKL and CLCF1;macrophage

In this study we have described essential roles for the transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ, which are key effectors of Hippo pathway signaling, in maintaining lung epithelial homeostasis. Phenotypes associated with Yap/Taz deletion include alveolar defects and a striking development of goblet cell metaplasia throughout the airways. Lineage specific deletion of Yap and Taz in Scgb1a1+ cells leads to increased Mucin production within the knockout cells in vivo. In order better characterize the in vivo transcriptional changes associated with Yap/Taz knockout in these cells, we have isolated Scgb1a1 lineage traced cells from control and yap/taz cNull mice and performed bulk RNA sequencing.

By evaluating the impact of the linker structure and length on crosslinking efficiency we were able to shed important light on what factors have the largest impact on photocrosslinking efficiency in this model system. Additionally, the best compound (compound 11) was shown to efficiently and selectively crosslink site-specifically to the PreQ1 aptamer even in the presence of competing human cellular RNAs. Sequencing experiments were performed in human MCF-7 cell total RNA both with and without spike in of exogenous PreQ1 aptamer. In the aptamer spike-in samples, the only RNA target that was significantly enriched after differential expression analysis with the negative control (compound 17) was the PreQ1 aptamer suggesting that this compound does in fact selectively crosslink to the desired target even in the presence of other RNAs. Additionally, in the samples without spike-in of the aptamer we were able to identify 16 significantly enriched hit RNAs that may represent novel metabolite-RNA interactions. Competitive RT-qPCR experiments confirmed enrichment of a handful of select genes with 11 and showed that the free PreQ1 ligand, which lacks the diazrine crosslinking moeity, is able to compete away compound 11. This suggests that these interactions are specific.		MCF-7 human breast cancer cells;NO;Compound 11;YES;Compound 17

In this study, we constructed a comprehensive atlas of 23,060 single cells obtained from surgically dissected superficial and deep layers of five diffuse-type GC along with matched normal. As a result, seven major cell types were identified. Fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and myeloid cells were categorized as being enriched in the deep layers. Cell type-specific clustering further revealed that the superficial-to-deep layer transition is associated with enrichment in inflammatory endothelial cells and fibroblasts with upregulated CCL2 transcripts. This study reveals the spatial reprogramming of the TME that may underlie invasive tumor potential in diffuse-type GC. This TME profiling across tumor layers suggests new targets, such as CCL2, that can modify the TME to inhibit tumor progression in diffuse-type GC.		patient2;patient1;patient4;patient3;superficial layer of gastric cancer of patient1;diffuse type gastric cancer;superficial layer of gastric cancer of patient3;superficial layer of gastric cancer of patient2;superficial layer of gastric cancer of patient5;superficial layer of gastric cancer of patient4;deep layer of gastric cancer of patient5;deep layer of gastric cancer of patient4;deep layer of gastric cancer of patient3;deep layer of gastric cancer of patient2;deep layer of gastric cancer of patient1;normal gastric tissue of patient5;superficial layer of gastric cancer;deep layer of gastric cancer;patient5;normal gastric tissue of patient3;normal gastric tissue;normal gastric tissue of patient4;normal gastric tissue of patient1

To identify prognostic markers for ovarian cancer, we performed RNA-sequencing and analyzed the transcriptome data from 51 patients who received conventional therapies for high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC). Patients with early-stage (I or II) HGSC exhibited higher immune gene expression than patients with advanced stage (III or IV) HGSC. To predict the prognosis of HGSC patients, we created machine learning-based models and identified RPL23 and USP19 as candidate prognostic markers. Specifically, patients with higher RPL23 mRNA levels had a worse prognosis and patients with higher USP19 mRNA levels had a better prognosis. This model was then used to analyze HGSC patient data hosted on The Cancer Genome Atlas; this exercise validated the prognostic abilities of these two genes with respect to patient survival. Taken together, the transcriptome profiles of RPL23 and USP19 determined using a machine-learning model could serve as prognostic markers in HGSC patients receiving conventional therapy.		recurrence:0;II;recurrence:1;No recurrence;III;recurrence:Not available;I;dead;IV;high grade serous ovarian carcinoma;Platinum sensitive;Platinum resistance;live;Not available

IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), a progressive lung disease with an unmet need for treatment, causes increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Abnormal wound healing is strongly implicated in IPF, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we reported that aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk provides self-sustaining pro-fibrotic signals in IPF. By performing RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in human lung fibroblasts MRC5 treated with either conditioned media (CM) from control or 4-OHT (4-hydroxytamoxifen) - treated ATIIER:KRASV12 cells (kindly provided by Prof Julian Downward, The Francis Crick Institute, UK), in which addition of 4-OHT acutely activates RAS pathway (Yao et al. Cell Death & Differentiation 2019), we identify several IPF-related pathological alterations. These include increases in GO terms related to extracellular matrix (ECM) and collagen, cell migration, and inflammatory response. Our data suggest that RAS-activated ATII cells crosstalk to MRC5 lung fibroblasts to augment their activation and migration.		MRC5 cells;Treated (4-OHT group);fibroblasts;Control group

In this study, we sorted humanhematopoietic stem progenitor cells, lymphoid progenitors, presumed ILC progenitor/precursors and mature ILCs in the fetal hematopoietic, lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, from 8 to 12 PCW,for single-cell RNA-sequencing, followed by computational analysis and functional validation. We delineated the early phase of ILC development, from hematopoietic stem progenitor cells to multipotent lymphoid progenitors and to ILC progenitors, which mainly occurred in fetal liver and intestine. We further unveiled interleukin-3 receptor alpha (IL-3RA) as the surface marker for the lymphoid progenitors with T cell, B cell and ILC potentials. Notably, we determined the heterogeneity and tissue distribution of each ILC subpopulation, revealing the shared proliferating characteristics of the precursors of each ILC subtype. Additionally, a novel unconventional ILC2 subpopulation (CRTH2-CCR9+ ILC2) was identified in fetal thymus. Taken together, our study illuminates the precise cellular and molecular features underlying the stepwise formation of human fetal ILC hierarchy with remarkable spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

The present study was undertaken to better understand the molecular pathways evoked during innate and adaptive immune responses as well as the chronic demyelinating stage of disease in response to JHMV infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Using single cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNAseq) on flow-sorted CD45-positive cells (CD45+) enriched from brains and spinal cords of experimental mice, we demonstrate the heterogeneity of the immune response as determined by unique molecular signatures and pathways involved in effective anti-viral host defense. Furthermore, we identify potential genes involved in contributing to demyelination as well as remyelination being expressed by both microglia and macrophages. Collectively, these findings emphasize the diversity of the immune response and molecular networks at defined stages following viral infection of the CNS.

After filtering reads mapped to contamination database, the reads that were uniquely aligned to the exon and splicing-junction segments with a maximal 2 mismatches for each transcript were then counted as expression level for corresponding transcript. Next, RNA-seq reads count data were downloaded from public resource GTEx project (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets) and 12 normal kidney tissue samples were extracted as controls. The differential analysis by fold change difference was carried out to identify dysregulated genes at 1.5 fold change. The differential expressed genes were then subjected to Gene Ontology function and Pathway (KEGG, Ingenuity IPA, BIOCARTA, NABA, Panther, PID, REACTOME, Wiki-pathway) enrichment analysis by Fisher-exact test. Conclusions: RNA sequencing data revealed that biological processes from upregulated genes were enriched for cell cycle, chromosome segregation, response to wounding, humoral immune response, and blood coagulation, suggesting that cell injury/regeneration, inflammatory response, and endothelial injury were the major disease processes involved. The biological processes from downregulated genes were enriched for ion transport, metabolic processes, and oxidation, likely secondary to severe tubular cell injury. Pathway analysis from both up- and downregulated genes showed enrichment of transmembrane transport, oxidation, and blood coagulation consistent with the GO terms analysis. Upregulated genes were enriched only for the FOXM1 pathway, which was recently reported to promote tubular cell proliferation during injury repair. Additionally, genes related to the renin-angiotensin system were downregulated, but ACE2 expression did not differ from normal controls.		COVID-19;kidney

In the current study, using next generation RNA sequencing approach in mouse embryonic fibroblasts we discovered that two structurally related flavonoid compounds, Apigenin and Chrysin exhibited moderate blocking ability of multiple transcripts that regulate rate limiting enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The observed decrease in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway correlated well with an increase in transcripts involved in generation and trafficking of ketone bodies as evident by the upregulation of Bdh1 and Slc16a6 transcripts. Impact statement - The hypocholesterolemic potential of Apigenin and Chrysin at higher concentrations along with their ability to generate ketogenic substrate especially during embryonic stage is useful or detrimental for embryonic health is not clear and still debatable.

Neuroinflammation is the hallmark of encephalitis, mediated in parts through the activation of brain-resident microglial cell, thus playing a critical role in determining pathogenesis. Deregulated activity of microglia can be lethal for the brain tissue. Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (Irf8) mediates differentiation and transformation of microglia to reactive phenotypes and also regulates antiviral response through cross-talk with interferon pathway.

Breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), one of the ABC transporters, has long been recognized as a pump that effluxes the therapeutic drugs against the concentration gradient. However, recent studies suggest that the biological function of BCRP is not limited in its drug-pump activity. Herein, the role of BCRP in the proliferation and survival of drug-resistant breast cancer cells was investigated. We found that BCRP is not the major drug pump to efflux epirubicin in the resistant cells that express multiple ABC transporters. Silencing of BCRP significantly impairs cell proliferation and induces apoptosis of the resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing and high-throughput proteomics suggest that BCRP is an inhibitory factor of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Further research suggests that BCRP is localized in the mitochondria of the resistant cells. Knockdown of BCRP elevated the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and eventually promotes the cell to undergo apoptosis. This study demonstrated that BCRP exerts important onco-promoting functions in the drug-resistant breast cancer cells independent of its well-recognized drug-efflux activity, which shed new light on understanding the complex functional role of ABC transporters in drug-resistant cells.

Sudan I has multiple toxicity such as carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, genotoxicity and oxidative damage. However, Sudan I has been illegally used as colorant in food products, triggering worldwide attention about food safety. Nevertheless, the toxicity of Sudan I on reproduction, particularly on oocyte maturation is still unclear. In the present study, using mouse in vivo models, we report the toxicity effects of Sudan I on mouse oocyte. The results reflect that Sudan I exposure disrupts spindle organization and chromosomes alignment as well as cortical actin distribution, thus leading to the failure of polar body extrusion. Based on the transcriptome results, it is found that the exposure of Sudan I leads to the change in expression of 764 genes. Moreover, it’s further reflected that the damaging effects of Sudan I are mediated by the destruction of mitochondrial functions, which induces the accumulated ROS to stimulate oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, while in vivo supplementation of melatonin efficaciously suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction and the accompanying apoptosis, thus reverses oocyte meiotic deteriorations. Collectively, our results prove the reproduction toxicity of Sudan I for the exposure of Sudan I reduces the oocyte quality, and demonstrate a feasible solution to mitigating Sudan I-induced meiotic deteriorations.

Methods: The m6A modification patterns in HS and normal skin (NS) tissues were described by m6A sequencing and RNA sequencing, and subsequently bioinformatics analysis was performed. The m6A-related RNA was immunoprecipitated and verified by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: The appearance of 14,791 new m6A peaks in the HS sample was accompanied by the disappearance of 7,835 peaks. The unique m6A-related genes in HS were thus associated with fibrosis-related pathways. We identified the differentially expressed mRNA transcripts in HS samples with hyper-methylated or hypo-methylated m6A peaks. Conclusion: This study is the first to map the m6A transcriptome of human HS, which may help clarify the possible mechanism of m6A-mediated gene expression regulation.		normal skin;anti-m6A antibody;hypertrophic scar;tissue;none

Methods: Lacrimal gland mRNA profiles of 24 weeks T2DM mice (C57 mice with high fat diet + STZ intraperitoneal injection) and counterparts were enriched by NEBNext® Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs), and the produced RNA was used for construction library, via KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Library Prep Kit (Illumina). The prepared RNA-seq libraries were qualified using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified by qPCR absolute quantification method. The sequencing was then performed using Illumina NovaSeq 6000. After quality control, the fragments were 5’, 3’-adaptor trimmed and filtered <=16 bp reads with cutadapt software. The trimmed reads were aligned to a reference genome with Hisat2 software. The transcript abundance for each sample was estimated with StringTie (v1.2.3), and the FPKM values for gene level were calculated with R package Ballgown (v2.6.0). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis was also performed with Ballgown. Fold change (cutoff 1.5), p-value (cutoff 0.05) and FPKM (≥0.5 mean in one group) were used for filtering differentially expressed genes and transcripts. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of T2DM lacrimal gland transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles.

GSE171357	2021.08.08	Mus musculus	GPL10333	TRUE	FALSE	2	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			The Protein Complex Ragulator is the Substrate-specific Scaffold for mTORC1 to Regulate Transcription Factor EB	Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway is activated by nutrition sufficiency signals and extracellular growth signals. mTORC1 acts the hub that integrates these inputs to orchestrate number of cellular responses such as translation, nucleotide synthesis, lipid synthesis, and lysosome biogenesis. However, the scaffold protein which specifically regulates any single downstream signaling molecule has not been identified to date. Here we show the heteropentamer protein complex Ragulator is critically required to regulate nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). We established a unique RAW264.7 clone that lacks Ragulator but maintained total mTORC1 activity. The clone showed a markedly enhanced nuclear translocation of TFEB even in nutrition-sufficient state, despite the full mTORC1 activity. As a cellular phenotype, the number of lysosomes were increased by 10 times in the Ragulator-deficient clone. These findings suggest that mTORC1 essentially requires the scaffold Ragulator to regulate the subcellular location of TFEB. Our finding implicates that mTORC1 has other scaffold proteins that regulate downstream molecules specifically.		control RAW264.7 cells;Lamtor1 knockdown;Lamtor1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells;RAW264.7 cells;control

To date, the molecular mechanism governing the gallic acid-induced cancer cell death process is largely unclear, thus hindering development of novel therapeutics.

PCSK9 is mainly expressed in hepatocyte. Here, we show that PCSK9 is highly expressed in undifferentiated hiPSCs. PCSK9 inhibition in hiPSCs with the use of shRNA, CRISPR/cas9-mediated knockout or endogenous PCSK9 loss-of-function mutation R104C/V114A unveiled its new role as a potential cell cycle regulator through the NODAL signaling pathway. Indeed, PCSK9 inhibition leads to a decrease of SMAD2 phosphorylation and hiPSCs proliferation. Conversely, PCSK9 overexpression stimulates hiPSCs proliferation. PCSK9 can interfere with the NODAL pathway by regulating the expression of its endogenous inhibitor DACT2, which is involved in the TGFß-R1 lysosomal degradation. Using different PCSK9 constructs we show that PCSK9 interacts with DACT2 through its CHRD domain. Altogether these data highlight a new role of PCSK9 in cellular proliferation and development, beyond its canonical effect on lipid metabolism.		shCt;Induced pluripotent stem cells;sh4
GSE181593	2021.08.07	Homo sapiens	GPL21185	TRUE	FALSE	8	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Subtypes in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma based on niche factor dependency show distinct drug treatment responses	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by abundant stroma in which microenvironmental (niche) factors promote PDAC progression. In mouse models, reduction of the stroma increased the proportion of poorly differentiated PDAC with a worse prognosis. Here, we aimed to clarify the effects of stroma on PDAC that may define the PDAC phenotype and induce distinct therapeutic responses. METHODS: The molecular features of PDAC based on differentiation grade were clarified by genome and transcriptome analysis using PDAC organoids (PDOs). We identified the dependency on niche factors that might regulate the differentiation grade. A three-dimensional co-culture model with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was generated to determine whether CAFs provide niche factors essential for differentiated PDAC. PDOs were subtyped based on niche factor dependency, and the therapeutic responses for each subtype were compared. RESULTS: The expression profiles of PDOs differed depending on the differentiation grade. Consistent with the distinct profiles, well differentiated types showed high niche dependency, while poorly differentiated types showed low niche dependency. The three-dimensional co-culture model revealed that well differentiated PDOs were strongly dependent on CAFs for growth, and moderately differentiated PDOs showed plasticity to change morphology depending on CAFs. Differentiated PDOs upregulated the expression of mevalonate pathway-related genes correlated with the niche dependency and were significantly more sensitive to simvastatin than poorly differentiated PDOs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CAFs maintain the differentiated PDAC phenotype through secreting niche factors and induce distinct drug responses. These results may lead to the development of novel subtype-based therapeutic strategies.		Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma;PDAC organoid, Grade1;PDAC organoid, Grade3;PDAC organoid, Grade2

In preclinical models, recruitment and infiltration of these cells depends on immune cell homing (ICH) genes such as chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, and integrins. We hypothesized ICH ligands CXCL9-11 and CCL2-5 would be associated with intratumoral T-cells, while CXCL13 would be more associated with B-cell infiltrates. Methods: Samples of human melanoma were submitted for gene expression analysis and immune cells identified by immunohistochemistry. Associations between the two were evaluated with unsupervised hierarchical clustering using correlation matrices from Spearman rank tests. Univariate analysis performed Mann-Whitney tests. Results: For 119 melanoma specimens, analysis of 78 ICH genes revealed association among genes with nonspecific increase of multiple immune cell subsets: CD45+, CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, CD20+ B-cells, CD138+ plasma cells, and CD56+ NK-cells. ICH genes most associated with these infiltrates included ITGB2, ITGAL, CCL19, CXCL13, plus receptor/ligand pairs CXCL9 and CXCL10 with CXCR3; CCL4 and CCL5 with CCR5. This top ICH gene expression signature was also associated with genes representing immune-activation and effector function. In contrast, CD163+ M2-macrophages was weakly associated with a different ICH gene signature. Conclusion: These data do not support our hypothesis that each immune cell subset is uniquely associated with specific ICH genes. Instead, a larger set of ICH genes identifies melanomas with concordant infiltration of B-cell and T-cell lineages, while CD163+ M2-macrophage infiltration suggesting alternate mechanisms for their recruitment. Future studies should explore the extent ICH gene signature contributes to tertiary lymphoid structures or cross-talk between homing pathways.		3C;poor prognosis;2C;peritoneum;FFPE fixed biopsy of melanoma;lymph node;melanoma;skin/subcutaneous tissue;small intestine;3A;3B

N7-methylguanosine (m7G) tRNA modification and its methyltransferase complex METTL1/WDR4 are significantly up-regulated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and associated with poor prognosis. We developed tRNA reduction and cleavage sequencing (TRAC-Seq) to reveal the m7G tRNA methylome inICC cell line and ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNAs sequencing(RNC-seq) and ribosome profiling(Ribo-seq) to study the differential translated genes and reveal the ribosome pausing. A subset of 22 tRNAs is modified at a ‘RAGGU’ motif within the variable loop. We observe increased ribosome occupancy at the corresponding codons in the Mettl1 knockdown ICC cell line implying widespread effects on tRNA function, ribosome pausing, and mRNA translation. Translation of cell cycle genes and EGFR signaling pathway genes is particularly affected.

Since such therapies benefit only subsets of patients, understanding the activities of immune cells in the TME is required. Eosinophils are an integral part of the TME especially in mucosal tumors.Nonetheless, their role in the TME and the environmental cues that direct their activities are largely unknown, especially in metastasis. We report that breast cancer-driven lung metastasis is characterized by resident and recruited eosinophils. Eosinophil recruitment to the metastatic lung was regulated by G protein coupled receptor signaling but independent of CCR3. Functionally, eosinophils promoted lymphocyte-mediated anti53 tumor immunity. Transcriptome and proteomic analyses identified the TME rather than intrinsic differences between eosinophil subsets as a key instructing factor directing anti tumorigenic eosinophil activities. Specifically, TNF-a/IFN-g-activated eosinophils facilitated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration and promoted anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, we identify a mechanism by which the TME entrains eosinophils to adopt anti-tumorigenic properties, which may lead to the development of eosinophil-targeted therapeutics.

However, the expression profile of LSECs during the late phase of regeneration remains poorly explored.

GSE181461	2021.08.06	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	15	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			TRIM28 is a transcriptional activator of the mutant TERT promoter in human bladder cancer	Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is a rate-limiting catalytic subunit of the enzyme telomerase, which plays a central role in maintaining replicative immortality in normal stem cells and many cancer cells. Mostly silenced in normal somatic cells, hTERT is reactivated in cancer commonly through highly recurrent hot spot point mutations in the hTERT promoter. Bladder cancer has a 60-70% hTERT promoter mutation prevalence, commonly at -124 bp from the translation start site, and this is associated with increased hTERT expression and poor patient prognosis. Identifying targetable signaling pathways that drive hTERT transcription from the mutant promoter could lead to therapies with reduced effects on normal progenitors. Here we describe a new platform that probes endogenous hTERT regulation by allele-specific insertion of GFP at either wild-type or mutant promoter allele within human bladder cancer cells harboring a heterozygous mutation. Using cells expressing the GFP-hTERT fusion protein, we performed a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 Kinome KO genetic screen to identify regulators of mutant hTERT promoter activity. We identified TRIM28 as an activator and TRIM24 as a suppressor of hTERT expression. Similar to hTERT, TRIM28 expression stratifies patient outcome and inhibits promotes cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, supporting their clinical relevance. TRIM28 and TRIM24 get recruited to the mutated promoter through GABPA, where TRIM24 interacts with TRIM28 and inhibits its activity as a transcriptional activator. TRIM28 phosphorylation causes its release from TRIM24 and activates hTERT transcription. mTOR phosphorylates TRIM28 through the mTORC1 complex leading to hTERT expression, while mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin analog Ridaforolimus suppresses the phosphorylation and promoter binding of TRIM28, resulting in reduced hTERT expression and lower cell viability. This study uses a bespoke platform to identify a novel therapeutically tractable regulatory pathway for cancers harboring mutant hTERT promoters.

Total RNAs and proteins were extracted in parallel. Protein lysates were used for checking the activation of anisomycin-induced decrease in phospho-Histone 3. Total RNAs from experiments that display a strong decrease in phospho-Histone 3 were selected further for RNA purification, library preparation and RNA sequencing. Results: Upon ribotoxic stress induced by anisomycin, we observed a set of genes with a p38 MAPK-dependent increase in mRNA level and pre-mRNA splicing efficiency. Among this set of genes, immediate early genes are highly enriched. Conclusions: p38 MAPK signalling upon ribotoxic stress leads to enhanced splicing efficiency of specific genes, which might be an efficient means to activate the expression of poised genes like immediate early genes.

Chemotherapy hadn’t led to desirable effect and targeted therapy brings about a new stage to cancer treatment. Ramucirumab is the first FDA-approved monotherapy for advanced gastric cancer. It is well known that gold nanorod, a nontoxic biocompatible nanomaterial, is an especially promising candidate for cancer theranostic. In this study, Ramucirumab (Ab) were first modified by gold nanoparticles to enhance uptake efficiency. The simple Nano-delivery system had taken perfect aggregation effect in vivo even better than 5-fold Ab treatment. Gold nanomaterials, especially gold nanorod (AuNR), could induce direct cytotoxic effect to cancer cell in the presence of Ab, while Ab or gold nanoparticle themselves couldn’t lead to such direct killing effect even at an extremely high concentration. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed the mechanism of this direct cytotoxicity.

In the present study, we found that SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression in NSCLC tissues was upregulated compared with that in normal lung tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database by using the GEPIA website. K-M analysis was performed to explore the effects of this molecule on the survival rate in NSCLC. The results demonstrated that SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was increased in human NSCLC, and high SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was correlated with poor overall survival. SH3PXD2A-AS1 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation and accelerates cell cycle progression in vitro. Animal studies validated that knockdown of SH3PXD2A-AS1 inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation in vivo. Mechanically, SH3PXD2A-AS1 interacted with DHX9 to enhance FOXM1 expression, promote tumour cell proliferation and accelerate cell cycle progression. Altogether, SH3PXD2A-AS1 promoted NSCLC growth by interacting with DHX9 to enhance FOXM1 expression. SH3PXD2A-AS1 may serve as a promising predictive biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with NSCLC.		SH3PXD2A-AS1 knockdown;human cell line;Negative control;NCI-H292

Cardiomyocyte growth is essential to withstand hypertensive stress, however whether immune cells are involved in this cardioprotective process is unclear. In normotensive animals, single-cell transcriptomics of fate-mapped self-renewing cardiac resident macrophages (RMs) revealed transcriptionally diverse cell states with a core repertoire of reparative gene programs, including high expression of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (Igf1). Hypertension drove selective in situ proliferation and transcriptional activation of some cardiac RM subsets, directly correlating with increased cardiomyocyte size and cardiac mass. Inducible ablation of RMs, or selective deletion of RM-derived Igf1 caused complete absence of adaptive cardiomyocyte growth and development of cardiac dysfunction without adaptive organ growth. Single cell transcriptomics identified a conserved IGF1-expressing macrophage subpopulation in human cardiomyopathy. Here, we defined the absolute requirement of RM-produced IGF-1 in cardiac adaptation to hypertension.

Through RNA sequencing we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of the dentate gyrus isolated from Btg1 wild-type or Btg1 knockout adult (two-month-old) mice submitted to physical exercise or sedentary. In Btg1 knockout mice, 545 genes were deregulated, relative to wild-type, while 2081 genes were deregulated by running.

Methods: Fresh PKM2 KO MCF7, PKM2 KO MDA-MB-231 and TMEM33 OE MDA-MB-231 cell pellets, and their respective parental cells, were used for RNA extraction. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each library was sequenced in single read mode, 1 x 50 bp, using the HiSeq4000 platform. Sequencing reads were aligned to human genome (hg38) by STAR (version 2.5.2b). Expression levels of genes annotated in GENCODE (version 24 for PKM2 KO and their parental cells; version 27 for TMEM33 OE and their control cells) were quantified by RSEM (version 1.3.0). Parameters of STAR and RSEM were set following ENCODE’s long RNA-seq processing pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were identified by DESeq2 (version 1.24.0) under the requirement of at least two-fold changes and an adjusted p-value < 0.05. Results: Differential gene expression analyses identified 269 and 504 significantly up-regulated and 204 and 289 significantly down-regulated genes in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 PKM2 KO cells compared to their parental cells (>=2-fold, adjusted P value < 0.05); Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that cholesterol homeostasis and fatty acid metabolism were among the top down-regulated pathways in MDA-MB-231 TMEM33 OE cells. Moreover, the differential gene expression profiles between PKM2 KO and TMEM33 OE cell lines were positively correlated. Notably, the mRNAs of genes related to cholesterol homeostasis were decreased in both PKM2 KO and TMEM33 OE cells. Conclusions: TMEM33 acts as a downstream effector of PKM2 that regulates activation of SREBPs and lipid metabolism.

Owing to advances in respiratory medicine, cardiomyopathy has become a significant aspect of the disease. While CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology holds great potential as a novel therapeutic avenue for DMD, little is known about the efficacy of correction of DMD using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in mitigating the cardiomyopathy phenotype in DMD. Objective – To define the effects of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing on structural, functional and transcriptional dysregulation in DMD-associated cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results – We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with a deletion of exon 44 of the DMD gene (ΔEx44) and his healthy brother. Here, we targeted exon 45 of the DMD gene by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate corrected DMD (cDMD) iPSC lines, wherein the DMD open reading frame was restored via reframing (RF) or exon skipping (ES). While DMD cardiomyocytes (CMs) demonstrated morphologic, structural and functional deficits compared to control CMs, CMs from both cDMD lines were similar to control CMs. Bulk RNA-sequencing of DMD CMs showed transcriptional dysregulation consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, which was mitigated in cDMD CMs. We then corrected DMD CMs by adenoviral delivery of Cas9/gRNA and showed that postnatal correction of DMD CMs reduces their arrhythmogenic potential. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of hearts showed reduced transcriptional dysregulation in CMs and fibroblasts in corrected mice compared with DMD mice, consistent with reduced histopathologic changes. Conclusions – We show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of DMD ΔEx44 mitigates structural, functional and transcriptional dysregulation consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy irrespective of how the protein reading frame is restored. We show that these effects extend to postnatal editing in iPSC-CMs and mice. These findings provide key insights into the utility of genome editing as a novel therapeutic for DMD-associated cardiomyopathy.

A majority of these are curtailed by early transcriptional termination followed by rapid degradation. The mechanisms and factors responsible for restricting non-coding transcription in this fashion are poorly characterised, but these RNAs vastly outnumbering those with coding potential. We identify ZC3H4 as a metazoan-specific factor controlling the level and extent of hundreds of unstable transcripts. The most striking effects are for antisense RNAs and those transcribed from super-enhancers, but a subset of protein-coding RNAs are also affected. ZC3H4 occupies these genomic loci and its level of recruitment correlates with RNA extension observed in its absence. Finally, engineered targeting of ZC3H4 to an otherwise unaffected RNA supresses its production and leads to rapid degradation, endowing it with the features associated with its natural targets. We conclude that ZC3H4 is a hitherto uncharacterised factor that restricts unproductive transcription.		3 Hr Auxin treatment, nuclear RNA;No variation;ZC3H4 associated DNA ChIP;CPSF30_R2_r1.fq.gz;ChIP_Z4_REP2.fq.gz;HCT116;Nuclear RNA;siZ4/Z6 treatment, nuclear RNA;siZ6_rep1_r1.fq.gz;CPSF30_R1_r1.fq.gz;siZ4_rep1_r1.fq.gz;siCONT treatment, nuclear RNA;ChIP_Pol II_REP2.fq.gz;siZ4_Z6_rep1_r1.fq.gz;CPSF30-mAID_P2A_[HygromycinR/NeomycinR]_SV40-pA; sleeping_beauty(TIR1; blasticidn).

Interestingly, a distinct intermediate stage during the naïve-to-primed transition has been recently described, the rosette stage. We propose the transcriptional repressor ERF as the MAPK-dependent switch that controls the exit from the rosette-stage of pluripotency. By using inducible ESC to genetically eliminate all RAS proteins, we show that, while differentiated RasKO ESC are reminiscent of the pluripotent rosette-stage, the absence of ERF overcomes the developmental blockage of RAS-deficient cells from this intermediate state. RNAseq data revealed that deletion of ERF restored the overall gene expression profile to a wild-type level in differentiated RasKO ESC. Mechanistically, ERF ensures naïve pluripotency by strengthening naïve pluripotent transcription factor binding and accessibility at specific ESC enhancers. Moreover, ERF regulates negatively the expression of the DNMT3 de novo methylases, which are essential for the extinction of the naïve transcriptional program. Our data revealed an essential role for ERF in the exit from rosette pluripotency as a regulator of the progression to primed pluripotency.		mouse ES cells_FA;ERF WT;(H-Ras-/-;N-Ras-/-;K-Raslox/lox;Ubiq-CreERT2);FA+OHT;mouse ES cells_2iL;mouse ES cells_FA-OHT;mouse ES cells_2iL-OHT;2iL;ERF WT; (H-Ras-/-;N-Ras-/-;K-Raslox/lox;Ubiq-CreERT2);FA;2iL+OHT;ERF KO;(H-Ras-/-;N-Ras-/-;K-Raslox/lox;Ubiq-CreERT2);Raslox/lox

The bone marrow is a well-established sanctuary site, and while standard of care treatments allows for complete remission in most patients, a small population of patients will relapse, likely due to the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) consisting of a dormant, chemotherapy-resistant cell population. We developed an in vitro cell culture model in which human ALL cells are grown in co-culture with either bone marrow-derived stromal cells or human osteoblasts. Within this culture, tumor cells can either be found in suspension, lightly attached to the top of the adherent cells, or buried under the adherent cells in a population that is phase dim (PD) by light microscopy. We have characterized the PD cells as being both a dormant and chemo-resistant cell population that relies heavily on glycolysis for energy. Additionally, we found that this model can be used to recapitulate MRD in vitro, as a means to identify and test novel therapeutics and treatment strategies that would allow for complete eradication of the disease from the bone marrow. In the current study, we characterized the transcriptional signature of the PD cells using RNA-Seq analysis, and this data was also compared to a published data set of human MRD B-ALL patients. Our RNA-Seq analyses showed that the PD cell population from the in vitro co-culture model closely mimics MRD expression patterns in patients. These findings suggest that our in vitro system can be used as a model for mimicking MRD. Furthermore, we identified both genes and key signaling pathways that were common between the PD cells and patient MRD that can provide us with potential therapeutic targets leading to a better outcome for the subset of patients that relapse.		r2;r3;acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line;r4;LTMC1S25L34;PDC2R13S37L34;LTMC16S40L34;LTMC11S35L34;underneath BMSCs in co-culture;PDHOB15S39L34;PDC2R3S27L34;PDHOB10S34L34;LTMC6S30L34;REH (a cell line for ALL);REH;underneath HOB in co-culture;above HOB in co-culture;PDC2R8S32L34;REH (ATCC #CRL-8286);cultured alone;r1;PDHOB20S44L34;PDHOB5S29L34;PDC2R18S42L34

While several therapeutic target molecules for lung adenocarcinoma have been identified, little is known about lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). We recently reported that CD271 (p75 neurotrophin receptor) serves as a marker for tumor initiation and is a key regulator of cell proliferation in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we found that CD271 was also expressed in squamous cell carcinoma, but not in adenocarcinoma, of several tissues, including the lung. To examine CD271’s role in LSCC, we established xenograft cell lines from LSCC patients. Within the sorted live LSCC cell population, the CD271high cells were primarily cycling through the G2/M phase, while the CD271low cells were mostly in the G0 phase. CD271 knockdown in the LSCC cells completely suppressed their proliferation and tumor-formation capability, and increased their cell-cycle arrest in the G0 phase. In the CD271-knockdown cells, ERK-phosphorylation was decreased, while no change was observed in the IκBα-, p65-, or Akt-phosphorylation. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 decreased the LSCC cells’ proliferation capability. Microarray analysis revealed that CD271 knockdown attenuated the RAS-related pathways. The knockdown of TrkB, which forms a heterodimer with CD271 and accelerates its downstream signaling, partially inhibited the LSCC cell proliferation. These results indicated that LSCC exclusively depends on CD271 for cell proliferation, in part through ERK-signaling activation.		MCC148c;sicontrol;human lung squamous cell carcinoma;siCD271

PCSK9 is mainly expressed in hepatocyte. Here, we show that PCSK9 is highly expressed in undifferentiated hiPSCs. PCSK9 inhibition in hiPSCs with the use of shRNA, CRISPR/cas9-mediated knockout or endogenous PCSK9 loss-of-function mutation R104C/V114A unveiled its new role as a potential cell cycle regulator through the NODAL signaling pathway. Indeed, PCSK9 inhibition leads to a decrease of SMAD2 phosphorylation and hiPSCs proliferation. Conversely, PCSK9 overexpression stimulates hiPSCs proliferation. PCSK9 can interfere with the NODAL pathway by regulating the expression of its endogenous inhibitor DACT2, which is involved in the TGFß-R1 lysosomal degradation. Using different PCSK9 constructs we show that PCSK9 interacts with DACT2 through its CHRD domain. Altogether these data highlight a new role of PCSK9 in cellular proliferation and development, beyond its canonical effect on lipid metabolism.

Here we have characterized the eye lens phenotype and transcript profile of germline Epha2 knock-in mutant mice homozygous for either a missense variant associated with age-related cataract in humans (Epha2-Q722) or a novel insertion-deletion mutation (Epha2-indel722) that were both located within the tyrosine-kinase domain of EPHA2. Whole-mount confocal imaging of clear lenses from Epha2-indel722 mice on a fluorescent reporter background revealed misalignment of epithelial-to-fiber cell meridional-rows at the lens equator and severe disturbance of Y-suture formation at the lens poles, whereas, Epha2-Q722 lenses displayed mild disturbance of posterior sutures. Immunofluorescent labeling showed that EPHA2 was mostly localized to lens fiber cell membranes with some sub-membrane localization observed in Epha2-Q722 lenses and diffuse membrane and perinuclear localization in Epha2-indel722 lenses. Immunoprecipitation/blotting studies indicated that EPHA2 formed strong complexes with Src kinase but not with catenin beta 1 or cadherin 2 and was mostly serine phosphorylated in the lens. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed differential expression of several cytoskeleton-associated genes in Epha2-mutant and Epha2-null lenses including strong downregulation of Lgsn and Clic5. Collectively, our data suggest that mutations within the tyrosine-kinase domain of EPHA2 result in lens cell patterning defects and dysregulated expression of several cytoskeletal proteins.

Upregulation of repeats such as MERVL characterises the 2 cell-like population in a mouse embryonic stem cell culture. Repeat element sequences contain binding sites for numerous transcription factors. We identify a the forkhead domain transcription factor FOXD3 as a regulator of repeat element transcription. FOXD3 binds to and recruits the histone methyl transferase Suv39h1 to MERVL and major satellite repeats in mouse embryonic stem cells, consequentially repressing the transcription of these repeats by establishment of the H3K9me3 heterochromatin modification. Notably, depletion of Foxd3 leads to the de-pression of MERVL and major satellite repeats and in turn the activation of a subset of genes expressed in the 2 cell state, shifting the balance between the stem cell and 2 cell-like population in culture. Thus FOXD3 acts as a negative regulator of repeat transcription, ascribing a novel function to this transcription factor.		Control;Foxd3 KO;Mouse embryonic stem cell;mESC

In particular, the presence and nature of a cellular hierarchy remains a topic of debate. Previous lineage tracing strategies in the pancreas relied on specific marker genes for clonal labeling, which left other populations untested and failed to account for potential widespread phenotypical plasticity. Here we employed a tracing system that depends on replication-induced clonal marks. We found that in homeostasis, steady acinar replacement events characterize tissue dynamics, to which all acinar cells have an equal ability to contribute. Similarly, regeneration following pancreatitis was best characterized by an acinar self-replication model, as no evidence for a cellular hierarchy was detected. In particular, rapid regeneration in the pancreas was found to be driven by an accelerated rate of acinar fission-like events. Together these results provide a comprehensive and quantitative model of cell dynamics in the exocrine pancreas.

Oxidative stress is a common mechanism of toxicity for neurotoxicants and is increasingly implicated in the etiology of multiple neurological diseases. While PON2 deficiency increases oxidative stress in the brain in-vitro, little is known about its effects on behavior in-vivo and what global transcript changes occur from PON2 deficiency. Therefore, we sought to characterize the effects of PON2 deficiency on behavior in mice, with an emphasis on locomotion, and evaluate transcriptional changes with RNA-Seq. Behavioral endpoints included home-cage behavior (Noldus PhenoTyper), motor coordination (Rotarod) and various gait metrics (Noldus CatWalk). Home-cage behavior analysis showed PON2 deficient mice had increased activity at night compared to wildtype controls and spent more time in the center of the cage, displaying a possible anxiolytic phenotype. PON2 deficient mice had significantly shorter latency to fall when tested on the rotarod, suggesting impaired motor coordination. Minimal gait alterations were observed, with decreased girdle support posture noted as the only significant change with PON2 deficiency. Finally, A subset of samples were utilized for RNA-Seq analysis, looking at three discrete brain regions: cerebral cortex, striatum and cerebellum. Highly regional- and sex-specific changes in RNA expression were found when comparing PON2 deficient and wildtype mice, suggesting PON2 may play distinct regional roles in the brain in a sex-specific manner. Taken together, these findings demonstrates that PON2 deficiency significantly alters the brain on both a biochemical and phenotypic level, with a specific impact on motor function. This data has implications for future gene-environment toxicological studies and warrants further investigation of PON2 in the brain.		Cerebellum;Striatum;PON2 deficient;Cortex;Female;Male;Wild type

Due to their scarcity and lack of validation tools, their biogenesis as well as their functions are largely unknown. Here, by using a newly developed circular DNA enrichment method, we purified eccDNAs from different cells and mapped their genomic location using both Illumine and Nanopore sequencing. We found that eccDNAs are mapped to genome in a largely random fashion, suggesting a biogenesis mechanism of random ligation of genomic DNA fragments. Consistently, we found that apoptosis inducers can increase the eccDNA generation, which is dependent on DNase 1/3 and DNA ligase 3. Importantly, we demonstrate that eccDNAs function as potent innate immunostimulants in a sequence-independent, but circularization-dependent fashion.		treated with synthetic circular DNA (200bp);Myd88 -/-;RNA BMDC mock treated;STING -/-;RNA BMDC Myd88_KO eccDNA treated;RNA BMDC STING_KO eccDNA treated;ES-E14;RNA BMDC C200 treated;RNA BMDC linearDNA treated;treated with linear DNA;Bone Marrow-derived Dendritic Cells;mock treated;RNA BMDC eccDNA treated;treated with eccDNA;RNA BMDM mock treated;RNA BMDM eccDNA treated;mESC;RNA BMDM linearDNA treated;Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages;WT

Due to its 12%-50% high fatality rate and the possibility of pandemic transmission, as well as no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment so far, SFTSV has been listed as one of the top 10 priority infectious diseases by the World Health Organization. Currently, there are rare studies of transcriptomic analysis for the patients infected with SFTSV, which makes it difficult to deeply understand the life cyle and pathogenicity of this virus. To explore the differences of transcripts after SFTSV infection, we performed a longitudinal sampling study to systematically investigate the chronological changes of viral load and transcriptomic and epigenetic characterization using white blood cells from SFTSV patients. The results showed significant changes in the expression of some genes from onset to recovery of SFTSV infection. Moreover, these differentially expressed genes showed good consistency in the three patients at different stages of treatment, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of SFTSV and thus lead to a breakthrough in SFTSV therapy. Moreover, by m6A-seq, we found some genes that might be regulated by m6A. This study in transcript changes and RNA modification may open a brand new direction to our understanding of SFTSV and play an important role in the drugs discovery for effective treatment.		white blood cell;Infection with SFTSV turned negative;healthy donors;SFTSV infection

Several stem cell populations have been described that mark specific sub compartments in the skin but none of them is IFE-specific. Here we identify Troy as a marker of IFE and HF infundibulum basal layer cells in embryonic and adult human and mouse epidermis. Genetic lineage-tracing experiments demonstrate that Troy-expressing basal cells contribute to long-term renewal of all layers of the cornifying epithelium. Single-cell transcriptomics and organoid assays of Troy-expressing cells as well as their progeny confirmed stem cell identity as well as the ability to generate differentiating daughter cells. In conclusion, we define Troy as a marker of epidermal basal cells that govern interfollicular epidermal renewal and cornification.

Methods: 27 children with OW/OB (10.14 ± 1.3 years, 59% boys) from the ActiveBrains project were evaluated. VO2peak was assessed using a gas analyzer, and participants were categorized into fit or unfit according to the CVD risk-related cut-points. Whole-blood transcriptome profile (RNA sequencing) was analyzed. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using Limma R/Bioconductor software package (analyses adjusted by sex and maturational status). Results: 256 genes were differentially expressed in fit children with OW/OB compared to unfit children with OW/OB after adjusting by sex and maturational status (FDR < 0.05). Enriched pathways analysis identified gene pathways related to inflammation (e.g., dopaminergic and GABAergic synapse pathways). Conclusion: The distinct pattern of whole-blood gene expression in fit children with OW/OB reveals genes and gene pathways that might play a role in reducing CVD risk factors later in life.		-2.19;E105_1;C71_1;C90_1;whole blood;E84_1;-1.82;E82_1;C96_1;-1.87;C104_1;female;E69_1;Unfit_1;C74_2_1;-1.17;-2.9;E73_1;E88_1_1;E92_1;-1.95;-1.12;-2.8;-2.7;-0.88;male;C67_1;C110_1;E108_1;E106_1;C70_1;-3.81;-2.31;-1.63;-1.64;C107_1;C78_1;E68_1;-4.18;-1.27;C99_1;-0.59;-3.05;C74_1_1;-1.39;Fit_0;9-11 years;E88_2_1;E93_1;C85_1;-1.32;-3.7;C28_1;C89_1;-3.15;-2.49;-1.4;-3.16

Abnormal EVT migration and/or invasion have been suggested to lead to pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia. The objectives of this study are to determine how exposure to hypoxia impacts gene expression and cellular motility of first trimester trophoblasts, and to assess if expression of migration-associated genes is dysregulated in 2nd trimester chorionic villous samples (CVS) from preeclampsia pregnancies relative to CVS from healthy pregnancies. The 1st trimester trophoblast cell line, HTR8/SVneo, was used to investigate the relationship between hypoxia and Notch signaling in trophoblast migration and invasion. RNA sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR analyses show that exposure to hypoxia (2.5% O2) activates Notch signaling in HTR-8/SVneo. We demonstrate that exposure of HTR-8/SVneo to hypoxia induces expression of genes associated with cellular migration and invasion and increases HTR-8/SVneo cellular migration and invasion, whereas inhibition of gamma-secretase decreases Notch signaling and decreases HTR-8/SVneo migration and invasion. Analysis of RNA sequencing data from CVS of preeclampsia and uncomplicated pregnancies identified significant differentially expressed genes that are involved in cellular migration and invasion. Decreased expression of migration and invasion genes in CVS from preeclampsia pregnancies, may impair trophoblast migration and invasion in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, resulting in the development of preeclampsia.		chorionic villus;HTR-8/SVneo;hypoxic;healthy pregnancy;preeclampsia pregnancy;HTR8 cell culture;Chorionic villus sampling;normoxic

Progress has been made to decipher the gene regulatory programs that are responsible for hypothalamus development; however, the molecular developmetal trajectory of hyothalamus is largely unknown. To understand how pre- and postmitotic transcriptional programs interact and coordinate to endow neuronal cell subtypes with their characteristic properties during hypothalamic development, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on single cells derived from Rax+ hypothalamic neuroepithelium at four critical developmental points during hypothalamic development. Our single-cell analysis provides a developmental landscape of mouse hypothalamus. We show that while the fate of radial glial cells (RGCs) is predetermined before differentiation but lack spatial code to distinguish from each other, different clusters of intermediate progenitors (IPCs) emerge to display diversifying fates and subdivide hypothalamic primordium into distinct spatially-restricted progenitor domains. We further characterize the maturation dynamics of hypothalamic neurons and suggest that immature neurons could evolve into multiple peptidergic neuronal subtypes. Finally, we identify sets of transcription factors (TFs) serving as regulons to determine the fate of diverse GABAergic and Glutamatergic neurons in hypothalamus. Together, our study offers a single-cell transcriptional framework for the hypothalamus developmental trajectory and propose a cascade diversifying model to deconstruct the origin of neuronal diversity in hypothalamus.

However, the genome-wide regulated targets of FSCN1 is still unclear in cervical cancers. Here, the gene expression profile of HeLa cells transfected with FSCN1 shRNA (shFSCN1) were compared with cells transfected with empty vector (shCtrl). The results showed that shFSCN1 extensively affects the transcriptional level of 5, 043 genes in HeLa cells. There were more up-regulated genes (3, 870) than down-regulated ones (1, 173) after FSCN1 was knocked down in HeLa cells. GO analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were associated with transcription regulation and DNA binding. The down-regulated genes were enriched in some cancer associated pathway including angiogenesis and cell adhesion. In particular, FSCN1 positilvely regulated ANGPTL4 in HeLa cells. Compared to normal tissue, both FSCN1 and ANGPTL4 showed a higher expression in cervical tumor tissue. Moreover, ANGPTL4 was also positilvely correlated with expression of FSCN1 in cervical tumor tissue of TCGA. In conclusion, our study provide important cues for further study on the regulatory mechanism of FSCN1 in cervical cancer.		transfected with FSCN1 shRNA;HeLa cell;transfected with empty vector

The disc phenotype is marked by extracellular matrix remodeling, actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, and suppressed proinflammatory gene expression, advancing our understanding of the contributions of TonEBP in intervertebral disc homeostasis and disease.

While several rehabilitation therapies are currently used in the clinical setting, their long-term effectiveness in treating contractures is marginal since they do not change underlying muscle biological properties. Therefore, new therapies based on a biological understanding of contracture development are needed. Here we show that myoblast progenitor cells from contractured muscle in children with CP had higher rates of proliferation than control cells from typically developing children. This phenotype was associated with upregulation of DNMT3a and patterns of DNA hypermethylation and gene expression that favored cell expansion over quiescence. Treatment of CP progenitors with 5-azacytidine, a DNMT inhibitor and hypomethylating agent, normalized this epigenetic imprint and promoted exit from mitosis. Together with previous studies demonstrating reduction in myoblast differentiation capacity, these data suggest that mechanisms of early myofiber growth and establishment of an adult population of quiescent stem cells could be compromised in CP. Hypomethylating agents like 5-azacytidine could be used to rescue myogenesis and promote muscle growth in contractured muscle and thus may represent a new approach to treating this devastating condition		N/A;typically developing (TD) control;Diplegic;AZA;Quadriplegic;Male;control;Hamstring muscle biopsy;contractured cerebral palsy (CP);From typically developing muscle (control), treated with 5-azacytidine;From contractured muscle in a child with cerebral palsy;Female;primary myoblasts;From typically developing muscle (control);From contractured muscle in a child with cerebral palsy, treated with 5-azacytidine

We report that LNPs containing stereopure 20α-hydroxycholesterol (20α) deliver mRNA to these cells up to three-fold more efficiently than LNPs containing both 20α- and 20ß- hydroxycholesterols (20mix). We show from the sequencing data that 20mix LNPs were sorted into phagocytic pathways, resulting in different functional delivery between stereopure and non-stereopure LNPs. We performed scRNA-seq using the 10X Chromium System, loading ~2,000 cells per condition, and processed the resulting data using Cell Ranger, resulting in an average read depth of ~100,000 reads per cell. These data suggest that stereochemistry-dependent interactions between LNPs and target cells can be exploited to improve mRNA delivery.

We have previously shown that paramylon (PM) supplementation to a high fat diet reduces the postprandial glucose rise, serum total and LDL-cholesterol, and abdominal fat accumulation in mice; however, the mechanism has not been determined. We evaluated the potential mechanism in male C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with 5% PM powder, extracted from Eu-glena gracilis, for 12 weeks. Abdominal fat weight, and serum lipids were measured; ileal and hepatic mRNA expression were assessed using DNA microarray and real-time PCR. The poten-tial mechanism of PM on modulating lipid metabolism was explored by gene ontology (GO) classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Dietary supplementation with PM resulted in decreased abdominal fat accumulation and serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations via suppression of the digestion and absorption pathway in the ileum and activation of the hepatic PPAR signaling pathway. Improvement in glucose tolerance may be the result of lipid metabolism modification because the glucose metabolism pathway was not detected by GO classification and KEGG pathway analysis. PM intake also directly enhanced immunoglobulin production.		ileum;liver in Mus musculus fed a paramylon diet;liver;ileum in Mus musculus fed a paramylon diet;ileum in Mus musculus fed a cellulose diet;C57BL/6J;liver in Mus musculus fed a cellulose diet

Methods: Wild-type (WT) and VISTA-deficient (Vsir-/-, KO) mice were treated with nephrotoxic serum to induced acute antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis, and their cytokine and fibrosis profiles were compared. Results: VISTA was highly expressed in kidney macrophages (resident more than infiltrating subset). If VISTA was depleted, tubules suffered further damage after glomerular injury. In damaged Vsir–/– mice, the contact frequency of macrophages with infiltrated T cells increased, and then the immunometabolic characteristics of T cells changed to overproduction of interferon-γ. The Vsir–/– parenchymal tissue cells responded to this altered milieu as more producing interleukin-9, which augmented tubulointerstitial fibrosis and irreversible kidney dysfunction. The blocking antibodies against interferon-γ and interleukin-9 protected above pathological process by VISTA depletion. Conclusions: VISTA is a sentinel protein of kidney macrophages, which prevents tubulointerstitial fibrosis via interferon-γ-interleukin-9 axis after acute antibody-mediated glomerular injury.

We determined the gene expression profile of 6 populations of human MSCs isolated from bone marrow and preconditioned for 6h in 2% O2 (hypoxia) or with 40μM Vadadustat (pseudohypoxia), compared to control cells cultured in 21% O2. There were 5 populations isolated from males and 1 population isolated from a female. The mean age of the BM-MSCs donors was 50.5 years and the median was 44 years. RNA-Sequencing was performed using the Illumina platform. For each library an average of 16 - 20 million read pairs were generated. Quality control checks of the sequencing raw data was conducted with FastQC, while adapter-trimming was performed with BBDUK2. The relative expression of transcripts were quantified for each donor using the Salmon program v0.8.1. Fastq files were mapped to the Homo_sapiens.GRCh37 reference genome using HISAT2 software version 2.1.0.

We therefore mapped genome-wide NEUROG3 occupancy in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived endocrine progenitors and determined NEUROG3 dependency of associated genes to uncover direct targets. To this aim, we generated a novel hiPSC line (NEUROG3-HA-P2A-Venus), where NEUROG3 is HA-tagged and fused to a self-cleaving fluorescent VENUS reporter. We used the CUT&RUN technique, an alternative method to CHIP-seq allowing transcription factor profiling from a low cell number, to map NEUROG3 occupancy and epigenetic marks in pancreatic endocrine progenitors (PEP) differentiated from this hiPSC line. To optimize the stringency and relevance of NEUROG3 binding sites, we focused our analysis on regions identified both with HA and NEUROG3 antibodies and integrated NEUROG3 occupancy data with chromatin status and gene expression in PEPs and their NEUROG3-dependence. Mapping of NEUROG3 genome occupancy in PEPs uncovers an unexpectedly broad, direct control of the endocrine gene regulatory network (GRN) and raises novel hypotheses on how this master regulator controls islet and beta cell differentiation.		hiPSC derived pancreatic endocrine progenitors, end of stage 5 (day 13);Venus-negative sorted pancreatic endocrine progenitors;NEUROG3-HA-P2A-Venus#clone31;Differentiation #29;3,900 sorted Venus-positive cells;100,000sorted Venus-negative cells;20,000 sorted Venus-positive cells;Differentiation #30;8,000 sorted Venus-positive cells;Venus-positive sorted pancreatic endocrine progenitors;100,000 sorted Venus-negative cells;20,000 sorted Venus-negative cells

Cancer cell overexpression of the multidrug transmembrane transporter gene ABCB1 thwarts therapy retention, leading to a drug-resistant phenotype. We explored the phenotypic impact of ABCB1 overexpression in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) via acute adenoviral delivery and in breast cancer cell lines with stable integration of inducible ABCB1 expression. One hundred sixty-two genes were differentially expressed between ABCB1-expressing and GFP-expressing HMECs, including the gene encoding the cyclooxygenase-2 protein, PTGS2. Several breast cancer cell lines with inducible ABCB1 expression demonstrated sensitivity to the 5-lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase-1/2 inhibitor tepoxalin in two-dimensional drug response assays, and combination treatment of tepoxalin either with chemotherapies or with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors improved therapeutic efficacy in these lines. Moreover, selection for the ABCB1-expressing cell population was reduced in three-dimensional co-cultures of ABCB1-expressing and GFP-expressing cells when chemotherapy was given in combination with tepoxalin. Further study is warranted to ascertain the clinical potential of tepoxalin, an FDA-approved therapeutic for use in domesticated mammals, to restore chemosensitivity and improve drug response in patients with ABCB1-overexpressing drug-resistant breast cancers.

We recently showed that hybrids made from the spontaneous merging of pre-malignant (IMR90 E6E7, i.e. E6E7) and malignant (IMR90 E6E7 RST, i.e. RST) mesenchymal cells recapitulate the main features of human undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), with a highly rearranged genome and increased spreading capacities. To better characterize the intrinsic properties of these hybrids, we investigated here their metabolic energy profile compared to their parents. Our results unveiled that hybrids harbored a Warburg-like metabolism, like their RST counterparts. However, hybrids displayed a much greater metabolic activity, enhancing glycolysis to proliferate. Interestingly, modifying the metabolic environmental conditions through the use of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carbox-amide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an activator of the 5’-adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), specifically reduced the growth of hybrids, and also abrogated the invasive capacity of hybrids displaying enhanced glycolysis. Furthermore, AICAR efficiently blocked the tumoral features related to the aggressiveness of human UPS cell lines. Altogether, our findings strongly suggest that hybrids rely on higher energy flux to proliferate and that a drug altering this metabolic equilibrium could impair their survival and be potentially considered as a novel therapeutic strategy.

Purpose: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from ethanol exposure to the developing fetus. FASD occur in up to 1-5% of live births in the United States and there currently is no cure. Ethanol exposure to the developing central nervous system (CNS) has profound effects on learning and memory, impulse control, and motor function, resulting from neuropathology. The purpose of the current study was to perform transcriptome analysis to evaluate the effects of early postnatal ethanol exposure in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Methods: Postnatal C57BL/6 mice were treated with 4g/kg of ethanol from P4-P9, brains were harvested 24h after the final treatment at P10, hippocampi and cerebella were microdissected, RNA was isolated, and RNASeq analysis was performed. We compared differences in gene expression, sex-dependent expression, and global biological pathways associated with disruptions in hippocampal and cerebellar genes between the ethanol and vehicle treated neonates. Results: Ethanol caused both an up and down regulation of genes associated with the hippocampus and cerebellum, which may result in the disruption of normal circuitry and maturation and growth in these brain regions. Ethanol increased the expression of genes associated with the S phase of the cell cycle in both the hippocampus and cerebellum. In the cerebellum, ethanol increased effector gene expression, and in the hippocampus, genes associated with different interneuron lineages were altered. Postnatal ethanol exposure also resulted in altered expression of genes associated with oligodendrocyte lineages and myelination, along with alterations in microglia associated genes. Conclusion: Collectively, these data indicate that ethanol has profound effects on the hippocampus and cerebellum, resulting in alterations of gene expression and biological pathways regulating neurodevelopment. These studies may have important implications concerning alcohol-induced neuropathology and the neurological effects seen across the life span in FASD.

While many statistical methods are available to identify differentially expressed genes, the principles that distinguish these methods and their performance remain unclear. Here, we show that the relative performance of these methods is contingent on their ability to account for variation between biological replicates. Methods that ignore this inevitable variation are biased and prone to false discoveries. Indeed, the most widely used methods can discover hundreds of differentially expressed genes in the absence of biological differences. To exemplify these principles, we exposed true and false discoveries of differentially expressed genes in the injured mouse spinal cord.		uninjured control;SCI (severe contusion of the thoracic spinal cord);SCI_Lumbar spinal cord;wild type;control_Lumbar spinal cord;Lumbar spinal cord;C57BL/6

To determine the impact of vitamin D signaling on prostatic precancerous lesions, we treated genetically-engineered mice harboring prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) with Gemini-72, a vitamin D analogue with reported anti-cancer activities, and comprehensively analyzed its effects on various cell types in such lesions. We show that this analogue induces apoptosis in senescent PINs and normalizes extracellular matrix remodeling by stromal fibroblasts in an epithelial VDR-dependent manner. Furthermore, it reduces the prostatic infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells in an epithelial VDR-independent manner. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrates that while a subset of luminal epithelial cells, expressing Krt4 and Tacstd2 (termed luminal-C) with enhanced interferon signature, is lost by such a treatment, anti-apoptotic pathways are induced in persistent luminal-C cells. Therefore, our findings delineate the distinct responses of prostatic precancerous lesions and the microenvironment to the vitamin D analogue, and shed light on mechanisms that limit treatment’s efficacy.

Wap-Myc mammary tumor cells, which express high Myc levels, were isolated from donor mice, transduced with the pIND21-HPN lentiviral construct that allows doxycycline (DOX)-induced hepsin overexpression, and subsequentially transplanted into recipient mice. Consistent with the notion that hepsin promotes TGFβ signaling, western blot analysis revealed increased phospho-Smad2/3 and upregulation of the TGFβ signaling downstream target SNAIL in Wap-Myc tumors with DOX-induced hepsin overexpression compared to control (-DOX) tumors. RNAseq analysis of these tumors provided additional evidence for TGFβ pathway upregulation by hepsin as the most significantly upregulated gene signatures corresponded to the TGFβ signaling pathway. The largest cluster of gene signatures affected by hepsin overexpression, however, was related to the ECM and integrins.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) indirectly regulates TGFβ activity by acting as a storage compartment of latent TGFβ, but how TGFβ is released from the ECM via proteolytic mechanisms remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that hepsin, a type II transmembrane protease overexpressed in 70% of breast tumors, promotes canonical TGFβ signaling through the release of latent TGFβ from the ECM-storage compartment. Mammary glands in hepsin CRISPR knock-out mice showed reduced TGFβ signaling and increased epithelial branching, accompanied by increased levels of fibronectin and latent TGFβ1, while overexpression of hepsin in mammary tumors increased TGFβ signaling. Cell-free and cell-based experiments showed that hepsin is capable of direct proteolytic cleavage of fibronectin but not latent TGFβ and, importantly, that the ability of hepsin to activate TGFβ signaling is dependent on fibronectin. Altogether, this study demonstrates a role for hepsin as a regulator of the TGFβ pathway in the mammary gland via a novel mechanism involving proteolytic downmodulation of fibronectin.

Therefore, a better understanding of how this mechanism is regulated has the potential not only to elucidate fundamental biological principles, but also to decipher pathological mechanisms implicated in diseases where normal splicing networks are misregulated. Here, we took advantage of human pluripotent stem cells to decipher during human myogenesis the role of MBNL proteins, a family of tissue-specific splicing regulators whose loss of function is associated with Myotonic Dystrophy type 1, an inherited neuromuscular disease. Thanks to the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) depleted in MBNL proteins and evaluated the molecular and functional consequences of this loss on the generation of skeletal muscle cells.

Here, we uncovered an IRF8-MEF2D transcription factor (TF) regulatory circuit as an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-biased dependency. Combining CRISPR-based genetic screens, transcriptional analysis, and chromatin profiling, we demonstrated that a chromatin regulator, ZMYND8, directly regulates IRF8 and MYC expression through occupying AML-specific enhancer regions. ZMYND8 was essential for AML proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. The ZMYND8-occupied IRF8 enhancer was further characterized using Circular Chromosome Conformation Capture and CRISPRi-based perturbation assays and was observed in  primary patient cells. Importantly, mutagenesis experiments revealed that the PHD/Bromodomain/PWWP reader module is required for ZMYND8 tethering to leukemia-essential co-activator BRD4 for enhancer-mediated gene regulation. Our results rationalize ZMYND8 as a potential selective therapeutic target for modulating the IRF8/MYC transcriptional networks in AML.		sgROSA;THP1;OCI-AML3;sgIRF8;MOLM13;MV4-11;leukemia cell line;day 4 after infection

Here we investigated the transcriptional landscape of 3880 somatic cells clustered in Sertoli, peritubular Myoid, Leydig, endothelial, stromal, T cells and macrophages from 3 human testis with idiopathic germ cell aplasia. Deregulated somatic pathways were associated with over-expression of paternally imprinted genes in immature Leydig cells, extracellular matrix composition and organization, hormonal milieu, chronic pro-inflammatory environments and early ageing, which were validated with an external cohort of 44 men with idiopathic germ cell aplasia compared to 102 age-matched fertile men.

We revealed five immune cell subsets, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes-macrophages cells, and disentangled the characteristic alterations of cell subset proportion and gene expression patterns in AD. Thirty-one cell type-specific key genes, comprising abundant human leukocyte antigen genes, and multiple immune-related pathways were identified by protein-protein interaction network and pathway enrichment analysis. We also found high-frequency amplification clonotypes in T cells and B cells and decreased diversity in T cells in AD. As clone amplification suggested the activation of an adaptive immune response against specific antigens, we speculated that the peripheral adaptive immune response, especially mediated by T cells, may have a role in the pathogenesis of AD. This finding may also contribute to further research regarding disease mechanism and the development of immune-related biomarkers or therapy.

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs), consisting of transcription factors and their target cis-regulatory sequences, control neurogenesis and cell fate specification in the developing central nervous system, but their organization is poorly characterized. In this study, we performed integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis from both mouse and human retina to profile dynamic changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and transcription factor footprinting during retinal neurogenesis and gliogenesis. We identified multiple interconnected, evolutionarily-conserved GRNs consisting of cell type-specific transcription factors that both activate expression of genes within their own network and often inhibit expression of genes in other networks. These GRNs control state transitions within primary retinal progenitors that underlie temporal patterning, regulate the transition from primary to neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type. We confirmed the prediction of this analysis that the NFI transcription factors Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix selectively activate expression of genes that promote late-stage temporal identity in primary retinal progenitors. We also used GRNs to identify additional transcription factors that selectively promote (Insm1/2) and inhibit (Tbx3, Tcf7l1/2) rod photoreceptor specification in postnatal retina. This study provides an inventory of cis- and trans-acting factors that control retinal development, identifies transcription factors that control the temporal identity of retinal progenitors and cell fate specification, and will potentially help guide cell-based therapies aimed at replacing retinal neurons lost due to disease.

We report an optimized protocol for CRISPR-mediated gene knock-in in human Tregs with high-yield expansion. To establish a benchmark of human Treg dysfunction, we target the master transcription factor FOXP3 in naive and memory Tregs. Although FOXP3-ablated Tregs upregulate cytokine expression, effects on suppressive capacity in vitro manifest slowly and primarily in memory Tregs. Moreover, FOXP3-ablated Tregs retain their characteristic protein, transcriptional, and DNA methylation profile. Instead, FOXP3 maintains DNA methylation at regions enriched for AP-1 binding sites. Thus, while FOXP3 is important for human Treg development, it has a limited role in maintaining mature Treg identity. Optimized gene knock-in with human Tregs will enable mechanistic studies and the development of tailored, next-generation Treg cell therapies.

In this article we describe circVAMP3, a novel circular RNA overexpressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. We demonstrate that circVAMP3 has a differential m6A pattern opposed to its linear counterpart, suggesting that the two isoforms can be differently regulated by such RNA modification although their sequence similarity. Moreover, we show how circVAMP3 depletion in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells can impair cell cycle progression, e.g. through the downregulation of the AKT pathway, pointing to this non-coding RNA as a novel regulator of the alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma progression and a putative future therapeutic target.

Immunotherapy strategies have been studied for IgE-mediated food allergies but have not been studied for non-IgE mediated food allergy disorders, including eosinophilic esophagitis. We interrogated the transcriptional signatures of peripheral CD4+ cells isolated from pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis patients enrolled in a phase IIa clinical trial of milk-antigen epicutaneous immunotherapy. We analyzed differential expression in peripheral CD4+ cells before therapy in patients before and after milk-exclusion diet. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that there were 244 differentially expressed genes in peripheral blood CD4+ cells of EoE patients consuming milk versus those eliminating it, and 129 DEGs in CD4+ cells isolated after EPIT versus after placebo (FDR<0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis identifies enrichment of hallmark interferon-a and -g response signatures in peripheral CD4+ T cells from EoE patients during active disease on a milk-containing diet. In post-EPIT therapy samples, our analysis identifies enrichment in T-cell receptor signaling, antigen presentation, costimulation, and cytokine signaling pathways. These data suggest a unique peripheral CD4+ T cell gene signature is present in EoE patients during active disease. We observe a distinct transcriptional profile post-EPIT therapy in EoE patients, suggesting that EPIT alters CD4+ responses in EoE patients.		none;Off;CH19;0-1;CH14;0-7;CH10;CH32;CD4+ cells from  blood;female;CH31;CH30;placebo;CH09;CH08;CH06;CH05;CH27;CH04;EPIT;CH23;CH22;CH21;CH20;male;On

Common laboratory mouse strains used for modelling human disease lack the genetic variability of the human population. Therefore, outcomes of rodent studies show limited correlation with human disease. The functionality of brain vasculature is an important modifier of brain diseases. Importantly, the restrictive interface between blood and brain – the blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as a major obstacle for CNS drug delivery. Using genetically diverse mouse strains, we aimed to investigate the phenotypic and transcriptomic variation of the intact BBB in different inbred mouse strains.We investigated the heterogeneity of brain vasculature in recently wild-derived mouse strains (CAST/EiJ, WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ) and long-inbred mouse strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, NOD/ShiLtJ) using different phenotypic arms. We used immunohistochemistry and confocal laser microscopy followed by quantitative image analysis to determine vascular density and pericyte coverage in two brain regions – cortex and hippocampus. Using a low molecular weight fluorescence tracer, sodium fluorescein and spectrophotometry analysis, we assessed BBB permeability in young and aged mice of selected strains. For further phenotypic characterization of endothelial cells in inbred mouse strains, we performed bulk RNA sequencing of sorted endothelial cells isolated from cortex and hippocampus. We did not detect differences in cortical and hippocampal vessel density and pericyte coverage among all the investigated strains. The staining patterns of endothelial arteriovenous zonation markers were similar in different strains. BBB permeability to a small fluorescent tracer, sodium fluorescein, was also similar in different strains. Transcriptomic analysis of endothelial cells revealed that sex of the animal was a major determinant of gene expression differences. In addition, the expression level of several genes implicated in endothelial function and BBB biology differed between wild-derived and long-inbred mouse strains. Our analysis shows that although there were no major differences in parenchymal vascular morphology and BBB permeability between investigated mouse strains or sexes, transcriptomic differences of brain endothelial cells point to variation in gene expression of the intact BBB. These baseline variances might be confounding factors in pathological conditions that may lead to a differential functional outcome dependent on the sex or genetic polymorphism.		129S1/SvImJ;hippocampal endothelial cells;cortical endothelial cells;WSB/EiJ;NOD/ShiLtJ;CAST/EiJ;female;C57BL/6J;A/J;sorted brain endothelial cells (CD45-, CD11b-, CD31+);DBA/2J;male

However, the gene-pattern variations within ductal and stromal cells remain unclear. Methods: We fulfilled scRNA-seq profiling with one healthy donor pancreas, one intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), and one PASC sample tissue. Multiple bioinformatics analyses were used to investigate the transcriptomics abnormalities from normal stage to tumor formation. Results: We identified ten subpopulations from 10,346 single cells, including myeloid, immune, ductal, fibroblast, acinar, stellate, endothelial, and malignant cells. Within our analysis, pancreatic cancer cells were further divided into five clusters; notably, cluster 1 exhibited stem-like phenotypes, such as UBE2C, ASPM, and TOP2A. We also found that S100A2 could be a specific biomarker for tumor cells, relating to PASC progression. LGALS1, NPM1, RACK1, and PERP were upregulated gradually from ductal to malignant cells. Furthermore, the level of copy number variation in ductal and cancer cells was significantly greater than reference cells. The expression of EREG, FCGR2A, FCGR2A, and CCL4L2 increased in myeloid cells along with tumor development, while cancer-associated fibroblast could induce the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, promoting pancreatic cancerogenesis. Finally, we demonstrated that EGFR-associated ligand-receptor pairs were activated in stromal to malignant cell communication. Conclusion: This study revealed the variations of ductal and stromal cells, defined cancer-associated signaling pathways, and deciphered cellular interactions following PASC progression. Thus, we provided valuable information to further understand the crucial regulatory mechanisms that embrace the potential therapeutic targets for PASC.		normal pancreas sample;Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm;Male;Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma;74 years;50 years;59 years

This effect is often mediated by stresses on host cells. We found that pre-treatment of mice with cyclophosphamide before cancer cell injection increases the amount of cancer cell colonization of the lung. We determined this effect is at least partially dependent on the stress-inducible gene, Atf3, in monocytes/macrophages. We used microarrays to profile gene expression in WT/KO lung monocytes/macrophages after chemotherapy treatment and intravenous breast cancer cell injection. This was in order to find candidate genes that mediated the colonization-exacerbating role of chemotherapy.

By utilizing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 dropout screen, we have identified the Paired box protein 9 (PAX9) as an essential factor for the cell viability of SCLC-A type, which accounts for approximately 70% of all SCLC. PAX9 is transcriptionally driven by the BAP1/ASXL3/BRD4 epigenetic axis and is overexpressed in human malignant SCLC tumor samples. Genome-wide studies have revealed that PAX9 occupies distal enhancer elements and represses gene expression by restricting enhancer activity. Genetic depletion of PAX9 leads to a dramatic induction of a primed-active enhancer transition, resulting in an increased expression of a large number of neural differentiation and tumor-suppressive genes in multiple SCLC cell lines. Mechanistically, PAX9 interacts and co-functions with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex at enhancers and they repress the nearby gene expression, which could be rescued by pharmacological HDAC inhibition. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the oncogenic function of the PAX9/NuRD complex epigenetic axis in human SCLC and suggests that re-activation of the primed enhancers may have therapeutic efficacy in treating SCLC-A type cancers expressing high levels of PAX9.		cells treated with DMSO, spiked in with 10% drosophila S2 cell chromatin;HDAC1_shPAX9_2;HDAC1_shPAX9_1;none;anti-H3K27me3 (CST #9733);anti-HDAC1 (activemotif 40967);cells treated with MERCK60;NCI-H1963;anti-MTA2 (abcam ab8106);PAX9 depletion;anti-PAX9 (CST #12847);cells treated with DMSO;small cell lung cancer;normal cells;HDAC1_shNONT;cells transduced with PAX9 shRNA #1;cells transduced with PAX9 shRNA #2;cells transduced with non-targeting shRNA;anti-H3K27Ac (CST #8173);control;HDAC2_shNONT;cells treated with MERCK60, spiked in with 10% drosophila S2 cell chromatin;Low passages (6-10);HDAC2_shPAX9_2;anti-HDAC2 (abcam ab7029);HDAC2_shPAX9_1;wild type;anti-H3K4me3 (CST #9751);cells treated with GSK126

Drugs neutralizing the common p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 represented a therapeutic breakthrough; however, new drugs that block the IL-23p19 subunit and spare IL-12 are more effective, suggesting a regulatory function of IL-12. In order to pinpoint the cell type and underlying mechanism of IL-12 mediated immune-regulation in psoriasis we generated a conditional Il12rb2-knockout (KO)/reporter mouse strain. We detected Il12rb2 expression in T cells and a specific subset of interfollicular (IF) keratinocytes. Analysis of scRNAseq data from psoriasis patients confirmed this expression pattern in the human skin. Mechanistically, deletion of Il12rb2 in the keratinocyte compartment led to exacerbated psoriasiform inflammation. Protective IL-12 signaling blocked the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, maintained skin barrier integrity, and, importantly, diminished disease-driving IL-23/type 3 immune circuits. Collectively, we provide a potential explanation for the superior efficacy of IL-23p19 inhibitors in psoriasis and describe an unperceived role of IL-12 in maintaining skin epithelial cell homeostasis.		untreated;K14Cre/+ Il12rb2fl/fl;skin;Aldara (topical) - day 1;Il12rb2fl/fl;interfollicular keratinocytes;C57/BL6

However, the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are not well understood. Here, we identify a novel role for the histone variant H2A.X in erythropoiesis. We find in multiple model systems that this histone is essential for normal maturation and the loss of H2A.X in erythroid cells results in dysregulation in expression of erythroid specific genes as well a nuclear condensation defect. In Addition, we demonstrate that erythroid maturation is characterized by phosphorylation at both S139 and Y142 during late stage erythropoiesis. Knockout of the kinase BAZ1B/WSTF results in loss of Y142 phosphorylation and similar to loss of H2A.X, a defect in nuclear condensation. In this study, we present a model in which post-translational modifications on histone H2A.X during terminal erythroid maturation leads to Caspase-Induced Chromatin Condensation (CICC). In this novel pathway, although apoptosis is specifically suppressed, aspects of the apoptotic pathway remain active to drive terminal erythroid maturation.

The striking difference in metastatic activity between HP and HPN melanomas strains provided a powerful system for identifying molecular profiles associated with metastatic activity. Methods: Primary and metastatic melanoma RNAseq profiling. Results: RNA-seq analysis of primary melanomas identified a 32-gene expression signature that was strongly associated with the HPN genotype and lung metastatic activity (HPN lung metastasis signature, or HPN-LMS). Expression of the HPN-LMS was highly predictive of overall survival in human cohorts of cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and uveal melanoma (UVM) patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Conclusions: Three HPN-LMS genes (ARRDC3, NYNRIN, RND3) associated with longer survival in SKCM and/or UVM patients exhibited strong anti-invasion activity in human melanoma cells, consistent with roles as effectors of the metastasis suppressor functions of Nme1 and Nme2. The HP/HPN mouse paradigm has thus yielded a network of potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for clinical management of metastatic melanoma.

We hypothesize that sGC stimulator, Compound 1, can enhance NO signaling, reduce proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy pre-clinical model with diminished NO-bioavailability and increased oxidized sGC. We therefore, evaluated the effect of sGC stimulator Compound 1 on renal effect in obese ZSF1 rats. Materials and Methods: The sGC stimulator Compound 1, the standard of care agent enalapril, and combination of Compound 1 with enalapril was administered chronically to ZSF1 rats for 6 months. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, creatinine clearance for estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary protein excretion to creatinine ratio (UPCR), and urinary albumin excretion ratio (UACR) were determined during the study. Histopathology of glomerular and interstitial lesions were assessed at the completion of the study. Results: While both Compound 1 and Enalapril significantly reduced blood pressure the combination of Compound 1 and enalapril normalized blood pressure level. Compound 1 improved eGFR and reduced UPCR and UACR. Combination of enalapril and Compound 1 resulted in marked reduction in UPCR and UACR and improved GFR. Conclusion: The sGC stimulator Compound 1 as a monotherapy slowed renal disease progression and the combination of sGC stimulator with enalapril provided a greater renal protection in a rodent model of diabetic nephropathy.		kidney;Enalapril + Compound1;Compound1;Enalapril;rat kidney;Vehicle ctrl

Here, we developed a sensitive method, NPC-DamID, which combines in vitro reconstitution of nuclear import and DamID technology. This fixation-free method specifically identifies genomic DNA interactions at the NPCs in intact nuclei. We found that NPCs are preferentially associated with common and hierarchically arranged super-enhancers (SEs) across multiple cells and tissue types. We also uncovered phase-separated condensates at NPCs that compartmentalize and concentrate transcriptional coactivators and structural proteins at SE-regulated genes. Our results support the idea that NPCs are sites of anchoring SE regulatory hubs through their interaction with CTCF and also maintains the conformation of SEs through interaction with structural proteins of SEs like Med1 and PolII.

Owing to advances in respiratory medicine, cardiomyopathy has become a significant aspect of the disease. While CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology holds great potential as a novel therapeutic avenue for DMD, little is known about the efficacy of correction of DMD using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in mitigating the cardiomyopathy phenotype in DMD. To define the effects of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing on structural, functional and transcriptional dysregulation in DMD-associated cardiomyopathy. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with a deletion of exon 44 of the DMD gene (ΔEx44) and his healthy brother. Here, we targeted exon 45 of the DMD gene by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate corrected DMD (cDMD) iPSC lines, wherein the DMD open reading frame was restored via reframing (RF) or exon skipping (ES). While DMD cardiomyocytes (CMs) demonstrated morphologic, structural and functional deficits compared to control CMs, CMs from both cDMD lines were similar to control CMs. Bulk RNA-sequencing of DMD CMs showed transcriptional dysregulation consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, which was mitigated in cDMD CMs. We then corrected DMD CMs by adenoviral delivery of Cas9/gRNA and showed that postnatal correction of DMD CMs reduces their arrhythmogenic potential. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of hearts showed reduced transcriptional dysregulation in CMs and fibroblasts in corrected mice compared with DMD mice, consistent with reduced histopathologic changes.We show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of DMD ΔEx44 mitigates structural, functional and transcriptional dysregulation consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy irrespective of how the protein reading frame is restored. We show that these effects extend to postnatal editing in iPSC-CMs and mice. These findings provide key insights into the utility of genome editing as a novel therapeutic for DMD-associated cardiomyopathy.		cadiac nuclei;AAV-corrected DMD;Wildtype;purified nuclei from heart;DMD;C57BL/6

The frequency of chromosome segregation errors in oocytes increases with maternal age, especially at a late stage of reproductive life. How aging at various life stages affects oocytes differently remains poorly understood. In this study, we describe aging-associated changes in the transcriptome profile of mouse oocytes throughout reproductive life. Our single-oocyte comprehensive RNA sequencing using RamDA-seq revealed that oocytes undergo transcriptome changes at a late reproductive stage, whereas their surrounding cumulus cells exhibit transcriptome changes at an earlier stage. Calorie restriction, a paradigm that reportedly prevents aging-associated egg aneuploidy, promotes a transcriptome shift in oocytes with the up-regulation of genes involved in chromosome segregation. This shift is accompanied by the improved maintenance of chromosomal cohesin, the loss of which is a hallmark of oocyte aging and causes chromosome segregation errors. These findings have implications for understanding how oocytes undergo aging-associated functional decline throughout their reproductive life in a context-dependent manner.

Approximately half of PDAC patients exhibit loss of SMAD4, which correlates with increased metastatic disease. Here we demonstrate that SMAD4 is a suppressor of metastatic colonization. Using isogenic human PDAC cell lines expressing or lacking SMAD4, both in vitro and in vivo, we define SMAD4-dependent gene expression changes in metastatic lesions. We performed a pooled in vivo open reading frame (ORF) screen of SMAD4 transcriptional targets and identified genes that, induce tumor seeding and growth at secondary sites. We found that expression of the transcription factor FOSL1 was sufficient to drive metastatic colonization. SMAD4 directly binds and represses the activity of the FOSL1 enhancer. These studies demonstrate a direct role for SMAD4 in regulating metastatic colonization and identify FOSL1 as a SMAD4-regulated gene involved in PDAC progression.

GSE146944	2021.08.02	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	9	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			The role of HOXC6 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression.	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers that lack effective therapeutic options. Here we show that the transcription factor Homeobox C6 (HOXC6) is overexpressed in PDAC and its inhibition blocks PDAC tumor growth and metastasis. By analyzing the HOXC6 shRNA expressing PDAC cells by RNA-sequencing, we identified PPP2R2B and MSK1 as key downstream mediators of HOXC6 function in PDAC. HOXC6 represses PPP2R2B to activate mTOR pathway in PDAC, which in part is necessary for HOXC6-loss induced PDAC inhibition. Additionally, HOXC6 expression is required for MSK1 expression and ectopic expression of MSK1 in HOXC6 knockdown cells rescues PDAC growth. RNA-seq analysis shows that MSK1 stimulates cancer promoting gene signature in PDAC. Pharmacological inhibition of MSK1 alone or in combination with mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin or everolimus) attenuate PDAC tumor growth. Therefore, these studies provide rationale for targeting HOXC6 transcriptional pathway to treat PDAC by inhibiting MSK1 and mTOR pathways.

Mice were injected with saline/AAV9 TRISPR Mef2d at P4 and sacrificed 8 weeks later. RNA was isolated by TRIzol/Chloroform and isopropanol precipitation. Ventricular tissue mRNA profiles were obtained using deep sequencing, in triplicates, using Illumina HiSeq4000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by DESeq2. qPCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. We present in this study a mouse model for cardiomyocyte-specific endogenous gene activation in the postnatal mammalian heart by CRISPR/dCas9VPR. As a proof of concept, we activated the pro-hypertrophic factor Myocyte enhancer factor 2 D (Mef2d) leading to functional decline, increased marker expression of heart failure as well as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy over a time course of 8 weeks. We furthermore observed no phenotypic consequence of constitutive dCas9VPR transgene expression in the postnatal heart. We therefore conclude, that the Myh6-dCas9VPR mouse model is a suitable tool for endogenous gene activation studies in the postnatal heart.

Our previous work described the role of nuclear Wnt effectors B-catenin and Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) in heart disease progression; revealing GATA4 as a Wnt-repressor in the healthy adult heart. However, there is an urgent need to dissect molecular players distinguishing regenerative vs. disease-specific responses. In this study, we report a GATA4-B-catenin interaction in the regenerative neonatal myocardium, despite high TCF7L2 expression. TCF7L2 displayed strikingly unique genomic occupancies: proximal in neonatal and distal in diseased hearts. Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analyses showed that TCF7L2 differentially occupied and regulated fatty acid metabolic genes in the neonatal; and cardiac developmental and vasculogenesis genes in the diseased hearts, clearly discerning these two cardiac states. De-novo motif search identified TEAD as a commonly enriched motif in both TCF7L2 and GATA4-bound regions in the neonatal hearts, suggesting its potential role in providing a regenerative context to this GATA4-B-catenin interaction. Altogether, our study mapped for the first time, novel genome-wide TCF7L2 and GATA4 targets in the neonatal hearts and identified stage-specific roles for the cardiac Wnt-GATA4 complex. These findings demonstrate strong context-specificity of the cardiac Wnt-nuclear complex, which can be further exploited for therapeutic avenues. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the transcriptome profiles (RNA-seq) of WT postnatal day 6 murine cardiac ventricles; and compare them to our previously published (GSE97762) adult and diseased myocardium transcriptomes. Methods: P6 cardiac ventricular tissue mRNA profiles were obtained using deep sequencing, in triplicates, using Illumina HiSeq4000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by DESeq2. qPCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays Conclusions: Our study identified distinct transcriptomic signatures of P6 murine cardiac ventricles, in comparison to healthy or diseased adult heart. Particularly, despite high Wnt signaling activities and cardiomyocytes cell cycling in both P6 and diseased hearts, P6 hearts are regenerative in nature, while the diseased hearts are not.

Following treatment, spleens and tumours were collected, processed to single-cell suspension and P1A-35-43-specific CD8+ T-cells were then isolated by MHC-class I multimer staining and FACS. Single-cell RNA-seq experiments were performed using the 10X Genomics platform to analyze P1A-specific CD8+ T-cell transcriptional profiles. Results of this transcriptomic analysis showed that cells segregated into distinct phenotypic subtypes reflecting either effector or stem-like states, the distribution of which was dependent on tissue of origin and treatment status. These results provide an in depth phenotypic analysis of MAGE-type-antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells induced by ChAdOx/MVA vaccination and how phenotype is influenced by physiological location and immune checkpoint blockade treatment.

Both the detrimental graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects occurring after allo-HSCT are largely mediated by alloantigen-reactive donor T cells in the graft. Separating GVHD from GVL effects is a formidable challenge, and a greater understanding of donor T cell biology is required to accomplish the uncoupling of GVHD from GVL. Here, we tested a novel mouse model of transgenic over-expression of human β-catenin (Cat-Tg) in an allo-HSCT model. Our data show that T cells from Cat-Tg mice did not cause GVHD. Surprisingly, Cat-Tg T cells maintained the GVL effect. Donor T cells from Cat-Tg mice exhibited significantly lower inflammatory cytokine production and reduced donor T cell proliferation, while upregulating cytotoxic mediators that resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing data revealed changes in the expression of 1169 genes for CD4, and 1006 genes for CD8+T cells involved in essential aspects of immune response and GVHD pathophysiology. Transgenic over-expression of human β-catenin primarily affects CD8+ T cell phenotype. Altogether, our data suggest that β-catenin is a druggable target for developing therapeutic strategies to reduce GVHD while preserving the beneficial GVL effects following allo-HSCT treatment		spleen;Pre transplanted;Cat-Tg;sorted CD8 T cell;sorted CD4 T cell;Wild type;C57BL/6;Post transplanted Day 7

Although they both belong to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the differences in clinical prognosis and molecular mechanism between them are remarkable. Recently, numerous studies proved that immune status of carcinoma patients influence deeply the clinical outcome. Based on the theory of “Immune edit”, many immunotherapies come out and tremendously extended the life of the patients. Thus, research on immune status is significant and essential. Our study aims to select specific lncRNAs which control the key immune-related genes to construct the risk model for AD and SCC respectively and the patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on risk score. The prognostic significance of risk score was validated by our own cohorts. Besides, The GSEA analysis suggested that immune response or process of AD patients in high-risk group was weaken while the situation is opposite for SCC cohort. The evaluation of immune infiltration reveled that the infiltrating degree of dendritic cell (DC cell) might be the important change for AD patients. In addition, the prediction of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) treatment, based on T cell immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) and immunophenoscore (IPS), indicated that the reasons for the deterioration of the immune microenvironment were T cell exclusion in AD patients and T cell dysfunction in SCC patients and the high-risk patients with SCC might benefit from ICIs treatment. Furthermore, the prediction of downstream targets via The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) database and RNA-seq analysis based on transferred lung cancer cell line indicated that lINC00996 was potential to become the therapeutic target for AD patients.		overexpressed AP001189.3;A549 cell;transfected PC3.2 plasmid;transfected PC3.1 plasmid;A549;overexpressed LINC00996;transfected PC3.3 plasmid

To identify regulatory elements that display differential activity across adipocyte differentiation, we performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq in a cell model of preadipocytes and adipocytes at days 4 and 14 of differentiation. For comparison, we created a consensus map of ATAC-seq peaks in 11 subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. A set of 15,919 adipocyte-dependent peaks showed stronger enrichment (60.1%) of adipocyte nuclei enhancers than 51,855 adipose tissue peaks (44.6%) or 18,244 preadipocyte-dependent peaks (11.5%). We linked context-dependent peaks to genes based on adipocyte promoter capture Hi-C data, overlap with adipose eQTL variants, and differential gene expression. Of 16,167 context-dependent peaks that could be linked to a gene, 5,184 were linked by two or more strategies to 1,675 genes. Among GWAS loci for cardiometabolic traits, adipocyte peaks showed the strongest enrichment for waist-to-hip ratio, coronary artery disease, and HDL-cholesterol, while adipose tissue peaks also showed significant enrichment for LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels. We identified 666 peaks linked to 507 genes by two or more methods and overlapping a GWAS signal, suggesting a regulatory mechanism at these loci. At one GWAS locus for palmitoleic acid, rs603424 was located in an adipocyte-dependent peak linked to SCD and exhibited allelic differences in transcriptional activity in adipocytes (P=0.003) but not preadipocytes (P=0.09). These results demonstrate that context-dependent peaks and genes can guide discovery of regulatory variants at GWAS loci and aid identification of regulatory mechanisms.

We defined the enhancer landscape of 22 pAML patient samples and observed many known leukemia regulators are SE-associated in pAML. We confirmed that the expression of several of these SE-associated genes correlated with gene expression by RNA-Seq. The retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene was differentially regulated in our cohort and present in all cyto/molecular subtypes tested, totaling 64% of the pAML samples. RARA SE-positive pAML cell lines and samples had higher RARA mRNA levels than RARA SE-negative samples and also were specifically sensitive to the synthetic RARA agonist tamibarotene in vitro, with halted proliferation and upregulated retinoid target genes. Tamibarotene prolonged survival and suppressed the leukemia burden of a RARA SE-positive pAML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model compared to a RARA SE-negative PDX. These data demonstrate the utility of leveraging chromatin regulation to identify new dependencies in pediatric AML and specifically lay the preclinical foundation for a tamibarotene trial in children with relapsed/refractory AML.

We showed recently that spinal cord astrocytes in mice lacking RGC-32 display an immature phenotype reminiscent of progenitors and radial glia, with an overall elongated morphology, increased proliferative capacity, and increased expression of progenitor markers when compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts that make them incapable of undergoing reactive changes during the acute phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, in order to decipher the molecular networks underlying RGC-32’s ability to regulate astrocytic maturation and reactivity, we performed next-generation sequencing of RNA from WT and RGC-32 knockout (KO) astrocytes, either unstimulated or stimulated with the pleiotropic cytokine TGF-β. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that RGC-32 is critical for the TGF-β-induced up-regulation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in brain development and tissue remodeling, such as axonal guidance molecules, transcription factors, extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins, and proteoglycans. Our next-generation sequencing of RNA analysis also demonstrated that a lack of RGC-32 results in a significant induction of WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (Wdfy1) and stanniocalcin-1 (Stc1). Immunohistochemical analysis of spinal cords isolated from normal adult mice and mice with EAE at the peak of disease showed that RGC-32 is necessary for the in vivo expression of ephrin receptor type A7 in reactive astrocytes, and that the lack of RGC-32 results in a higher number of homeodomain-only protein homeobox (HOPX)+ and CD133+ radial glia cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that RGC-32 plays a major role in modulating the transcriptomic changes in astrocytes that ultimately lead to molecular programs involved in astrocytic differentiation and reactive changes during neuroinflammation.		untreated;Primary neonatal brain astrocytes;Primary neonatal astrocytes;post natal day 1;treated with TGF-Beta for 24h;wild type;C57BL/6;RGC-32 knock-out

However, how BC influences glucose homeostasis remains unknown. Here we show that BC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) suppress pancreatic endocrine secretion to systemically reset glucose homeostasis. In pancreatic β-cells, miR-122 delivered in BC-derived EVs targets PKM to suppress glycolysis and ATP-dependent insulin exocytosis. Mice receiving high-miR-122 EVs or bearing BC xenograft tumors, but not those with tumors deficient in EV secretion or miR-122, exhibit suppressed insulin secretion, enhanced endogenous glucose production, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperglycemia. Compared to non-cancer controls, BC patients have higher levels of EV-encapsulated miR-122 and fasting glucose but lower insulin levels in blood; the miR-122 levels are positively associated with glucose and negatively associated with insulin. This EV-mediated glucose reallocation at the whole-body level may contribute to tumor growth and progression, as well as higher incidence of diabetes in BC patients.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal disease model of multiple sclerosis (MS) that involves the immune system and central nervous system (CNS). However, it is unclear how genetic predispositions promote neuroinflammation in MS and EAE. Here, we investigated how partial loss-of-function of suppressor of SMEK1facilitates the onset of MS and EAE. Smek1 deficient mice showed more severe symptoms after EAE immunization. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the cortices and hippocampus from 2-month old Smek1-/- and wild type littermates. Twelve cell types were identified in 6 tissue samples. Addtionally, we found a unique microglia subtype in Smek1-/- CNS that highly express IL-1β. Further analysis revealed enrichment of macrophage Csf1 in the novel microglia cluster. These findings confirmed that with loss of function of Smek1, a novel Csf1+ microglial cluster had a preactivated phenotype that may promote neuroinflammation.		cortices and hippocampus;2-month old;C57BL/6

GSE168388	2021.08.01	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	5	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Maturation signatures of conventional dendritic cell subtypes in COVID-19 reflect direct viral sensing	Growing evidence suggests that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) undergo aberrant maturation in COVID-19 and this negatively affects T cell activation. The presence of effector T cells in mild patients and dysfunctional T cells in severely ill patients suggests that adequate T cell responses limit disease severity. Understanding how cDCs cope with SARS-CoV-2 can help elucidate how protective immune responses are generated. Here, we report that cDC2 subtypes exhibit similar infection-induced gene signatures with the up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes and IL-6 signaling pathways. Furthermore, comparing cDCs between severe and mild patients, we find in the former a profound down-regulation of genes encoding molecules involved in antigen presentation, such as MHCII, β2M, TAP and costimulatory proteins, while an opposite trend is observed for proinflammatory molecules, like complement and coagulation factors. Therefore, as disease severity increases, cDC2s enhance inflammatory properties and lose antigen presentation capacity. Moreover, DC3s show the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and accumulate during infection. In vitro, direct exposure of cDC2s to the virus recapitulates the type of activation observed in vivo. Our findings provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 interacts directly with cDC2s and, by downregulating crucial molecules required for T cell activation, implements an efficient immune escape mechanism that correlates with disease severity.

GSE166530	2021.08.01	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	41	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Deciphering the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection	SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus causing COVID-19 which first emerged in Wuhan, China and was later declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Since then the economical, health and human cost has been enormous for the world. However, little work has been done to understand the transcriptional changes brought about by the virus in human hosts. We have compared COVID-19 positive samples with negative samples from Indian patients to better understand the host response.. We find many genes related to immune response up-regulated in the COVID-19 patients. Many of these are the usual response genes against the viral infection but type I interferon appears to be a key immune response activated against SARS-CoV-2. A large number of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated pointing towards translational arrest and down regulation of host mRNA during late infection. The down-regulated genes are well correlated with the clinical manifestations and symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection such as the loss of smell and taste. We also find evidence of altered gene expression profiles associated with systemic complications such as neurological disturbances and high insulin requirement. Finally, we have identified many lncRNAs being down-regulated during COVID-19 infections. A few of these lncRNAs have functional role in viral infection. However, to understand the functional role of other lncRNAs, we looked at the function of their closest gene, since lncRNA are believed to have cis functionality. Our analysis suggests a role for lncRNA in down-regulation of metabolic and developmental processes during COVID-19 infection.

Here we show a role for eosinophils in host resistance to Mtb infection. In humans, eosinophils are found in resected human TB lung lesions and autopsy granulomas. Eosinophils are also found in granulomas in zebrafish, mice, and non-human primates, where they are functionally activated and degranulate. Transcriptional profiling of lung tissue after Mtb infection of mice, that selectively lack eosinophils, revealed changes in neuronal associated pathways. Importantly, employing several independent models of eosinophil deficiency in mice, we demonstrate that eosinophils are required for optimal pulmonary bacterial control and host survival after Mtb infection. Collectively, our findings establish an unexpected role for eosinophils, granulocytes typically associated with type II inflammation, in host resistance against Mtb, a major human bacterial pathogen.

Arginine methylation is essential for both cellular viability and development and is also dysregulated in cancer. PRMTs catalyze the post translational monomethylation (Rme1/MMA, catalyzed by Type I-III), asymmetric (Rme2a/ADMA, Type I enzymes)-, or symmetric (Rme2s/SDMA, Type II enzymes) dimethylation of arginine. Despite many studies, a thorough integration of PRMT enzyme substrate determination and proteomic and transcriptomic consequences of inhibiting Type I and II PRMTs is lacking. To characterize cellular substrates for Type I (Rme2a) and Type II (Rme2s) PRMTs, human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were treated with either Type I (MS023) or Type II (GSK591) inhibitors. Using total proteome hydrolysis, we developed a new mass spectrometry approach to analyze total arginine and lysine content. We showed that Rme1 was a minor population (~0.1% of total arginine), Rme2a was highly abundant (~1.1%), and Rme2s was intermediate (~0.4%). While Rme2s was mostly eliminated by GSK591 treatment, total Rme1 and Rme2a were more resistant to perturbation. To quantitatively characterize substrate preferences of the major enzymes PRMT1, PRMT4(CARM1), and PRMT5, we used oriented peptide array libraries (OPAL) in methyltransferase assays. We demonstrated that while PRMT5 tolerates aspartic acid residues in the substrate, PRMT1 does not. Importantly, PRMT4 methylated previously uncharacterized hydrophobic motifs. To integrate our studies, we performed PTMScan on PRMT-inhibited A549 cells and enriched for methylated arginine containing tryptic peptides. For detection of highly charged peptides, a method to analyze the samples using electron transfer dissociation was developed. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct methylated species enriched in nuclear function, RNA-binding, intrinsically disordered domains, and liquid-liquid phase separation. Parallel studies with proteomics and RNA-Seq revealed distinct, but ontologically overlapping, consequences to PRMT inhibition. Overall, we demonstrate a wider PRMT substrate diversity and methylarginine functional consequence than previously shown.		GSK591;DMSO;A549;MS023;epithelial

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is an epigenetic regulator that is upregulated in most tumor types, and PRMT5 inhibitors (PRMT5i) are now in clinical trials. Here we describe the first model of resistance to PRMT5 inhibition, using cell lines derived from murine Kras-G12D;p53-null lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD). Initially, PRMT5 inhibition induced proliferation defects and apoptosis, but eventually we were able to generate numerous independent PRMT5i resistant lines. Resistance was drug-induced, not preexisting, and reflects a novel, shared transcriptional state. This state is stable, and it creates a collateral sensitivity to the taxane, paclitaxel. Accordingly, PRMT5i and paclitaxel synergistically suppress Kras-G12D;p53-null murine LUAD cells. Remarkably, a single gene Stathmin 2 (Stmn2) is required for both PRMT5i resistance and paclitaxel sensitivity. Finally, analysis of TCGA patient data showed that high Stmn2 levels correlates with good tumor responses to taxane treatment.

However, it is unclear if and how aberrant SG behavior is linked to the downstream formation of protein aggregates and other molecular defects that persist after stress subsides. Using subcellular fractionation combined with RNA-seq (CeFra-seq) we characterize the global mRNA localization landscape in human pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neuron (PS-MN). Using CeFra-seq and quantitative proteomics, we find that transient stress leads to a widespread reshaping of mRNA and protein localization that recapitulates key molecular phenotypes of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). While the substantial reorganization of the global mRNA localization landscape is largely reversible in wild type PS-MNs, we find that cells harboring ALS-linked mutations in HNRNPA2B1 are unable to recover and display a delayed-onset increase in neuronal cell death in response to stress. Our findings reaffirm the importance of stress-induced molecular mechanisms in the formation of molecular disease pathology of ALS and highlight the importance of targeting SG-relevant molecular mechanisms in the development of therapeutic strategies.		motor neurons;stem cells;Nucleus;Kin2ALS4 hiPSC line;CV-B hiPSC line;hESC-derived motor neurons;CV-C hiPSC line;Recovery;Puromycin;hiPSCs;CR463.4 hiPSC line;Untreated;H9 ESC line;Insoluble;ESC-derived motor neurons;Total;CR464.2 hiPSC line;iPSC-derived motor neurons;H1 ESC line;hESCs;Cytoplasm

However, the different roles of heterogeneous NK cell subpopulations have not been elucidated in MM. Here, we delineate memory-like NK cells in the bone marrow (BM) of newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients using single-cell RNA sequencing, and further characterize their distinct immunophenotypic features and functions by multicolor flow cytometry. Memory-like NK cells exert robust daratumumab-mediated effector functions ex vivo, including cytokine production and degranulation, compared to conventional NK cells. The composition of memory-like NK cells in BM determines the daratumumab-mediated ex vivo functional activity of BM NK cells in NDMM patients. Unlike conventional NK cells, sorted memory-like NK cells from the BM of NDMM patients exert substantial cytotoxic activity against myeloma cells in the presence of daratumumab. Our findings indicate that memory-like NK cells are an important mediator of daratumumab-dependent effector functions in MM and support direct future efforts to better predict and improve the clinical efficacy of therapeutic antibodies by selectively employing memory-like NK cells.		multiple myeloma;Natural killer (NK) cells;Bone marrow

LM growth requires progesterone, progesterone receptor (PGR), and the maintenance and proliferation of a small (5%) stem cell population. Stem cell activation and differentiation are driven by DNA methylation and nuclear hormone receptor action, but crosstalk between these mechanisms remains unclear. We performed an integrated analysis of the transcriptome and epigenetic landscape of LM cells at three differentiation stages and the PGR cistrome of whole LM tissue. The PGR-deficient stem cell population harbored a unique methylation landscape, with hypermethylation at the PGR gene locus and PGR-binding regions, which suppressed stem cell responsiveness to progesterone. The DNA methylation inhibitor 5’-Aza upregulated the expression of PGR and its target genes by stimulating PGR recruitment to the targeted gene loci, and significantly depleted the LM stem cell population and its tumor-initiating capacity.

Our objectives were to 1) establish a novel classification method to predict PPARγ-interacting and modifying chemicals and 2) create taxonomy labels to group chemicals based on their effects on PPARγ’s transcriptome and downstream metabolic functions. We tested the hypothesis that an environmental ligand highly ranked by the taxonomy, but that segregated from the therapeutic ligands, would induce white but not brite adipogensis. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in the presence of 76 chemicals (negative controls, synthetic nuclear receptor ligands known to influence adipocyte biology, suspected environmental PPARγ ligands). Differentiation was assessed by measuring lipid accumulation. mRNA expression was determined by highly multiplexed RNA-Seq and validated by RT-qPCR. A novel classification model was developed using an amended random forest procedure. A subset of environmental contaminants identified as strong PPARγ agonists were characterized further for lipid handling, mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular respiration in 3T3-L1 cells and primary human preadipocytes. The 76 chemicals generated a spectrum of adipogenic differentiation. We used lipid accumulation and RNA sequencing data to develop a classification system that 1) identified PPARγ agonists and 2) sorted agonists into likely white or brite adipocyte inducers. Expression of Cidec, was the most efficacious indicator for strong PPARγ activation. Two known environmental PPARγ ligands, tetrabromobisphenol A, and triphenyl phosphate, which sorted distinctly from therapeutic ligands, induced white but not brite adipocyte genes and induced fatty acid uptake but not mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells.

Increasing evidence from developmental biology and tissue engineering suggest that regional specification by tissue of origin exists among human pericytes. Here, we sought to define the differentiation of CD146+ human pericytes from skeletal and soft tissue sources. Uncultured CD146+CD31-CD45- pericytes were derived by fluorescent activated cell sorting from human periosteum, adipose, or dermal tissue. Periosteal CD146+CD31-CD45- cells retained canonical features of pericytes, including cell surface marker expression, multilineage differentiation potential, and paracrine induced tubulogenesis. Periosteal pericytes demonstrated a striking tendency to undergo osteoblastogenesis, while soft tissue pericytes did not in vitro or in vivo. Microarray analysis demonstrated substantive differences between periosteal pericytes in comparison to their soft tissue pericyte counterparts. In sum, skeletal and soft tissue pericytes differ in their relative lineage differentiation potential and ability to form bone. Human tissues were microdissected, digested, and FACS sorted to derived a CD146+CD31-CD45- pericyte population, and cells were expanded in standard growth medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep) and nucleic acid isolated at subconfluency		human dermis biopsy;human periosteum biopsy;Dermal pericyte;Adipose pericyte;human adipose biopsy;Periosteal pericyte

The fates and functions of these infiltrating monocytes governing the progression of heart failure remain unclear. Here, we created parabiotic EAM and naïve mice to show that cardiac inflammation facilitate monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Using a combination of flow cytometry, time lapsed imaging and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrated in vitro that cardiac fibroblasts interact with monocytes and are instrumental in facilitating monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. Moreover, IL-17A stimulated cardiac fibroblasts completely arrested Ly6Clo monocyte proliferation and inhibited both Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation both in vitro and in vivo after intracardiac injections of monocytes into the hearts. Intriguingly, IL-17A signaling through cardiac fibroblasts also significantly downregulated Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) expressions on Ly6Chi monocyte-derived macrophages, thus jeopardizing their phagocytic abilities. Collectively, our results implicate divergent fates and functions of heart-infiltrating monocytes influenced by cardiac fibroblasts.		splenic monocytes co-cultured with cardiac fibroblasts;Ly6Chi monocytes;spleen;Ly6Chi + CF;Ly6lo monocytes;control;Ly6lo + CF;IL-17A stimulation;Ly6Chi + CF + IL-17

To understand how ERG1 executes its function during differentiation, we performed RNA-seq experiments in Kcnh2-/- and wild-type rEBs at day 4 Methods: RNA profiles of day 4 wild type (WT) and Kcnh2-/- rEBs were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Illumina Hiseq. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 35 million sequence reads per sample to the rat genome (build mm9) and identified 16,014 transcripts in the retinas of WT and Kcnh2−/− rESC with TopHat workflow. RNA-seq datashows 211 differentially expressed gene with a fold change ≥2 and p value <0.01, in which 109 genes were downregulated and 102 genes were upregulateds.Altered expression of 25 genes was confirmed with qRT–PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method.Based on GO enrichment analysis results, the deletion of Kcnh2 resulted in the impaired heart development and cell differentiation by inhibiting the expression of heart related genes. KEGG enrichment analysis of all differentially expressed genes yielded the enrichment for several cell differentiation signaling pathways, like PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway, which is consistent with the experiment results. Conclusions: Our study represents the detailed analysis of transcriptomes of Kcnh2-/- vs. WT rat embryonic stem cell, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.

These niches maintain stem cells in a dormant state and promote self-renewal. The most potent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with high self-renewal potential are reportedly enriched in the endosteal compared to the central region of the bone marrow. Therefore we analyzed the global transcriptome of the endosteal region and directly compared it to that of the central bone marrow (BM). This comparative, differential analysis revealed that in addition to genes specific to the osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineage and classic regulators of HSC (CXCL12, KIT ligand, angiopoietin-1, Jagged-1, N-cadherin), the endosteum abundantly expresses prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) synthase (Ptgis), which produces PGI2. PGI2 is a highly labile, lipid metabolite with no known roles in regulating HSCs. We show in this study that PGI2 is a potent regulator of HSC function. Therefore comparing endosteal versus central BM transcriptome is a viable approach for uncovering candidate genes that may regulate the function of HSC and the HSC niche.		8 weeks;Central Bone Marrow;Male;Femur (Central Bone Marrow);Endosteal;Femur (Endosteal);C57BL/6

Following treatment, RNA was isolated from tumour tissue samples and then tumour transcriptomic gene expression profiles were analysed by RNA-sequencing. Sequenced reads were mapped to the mouse genome GRCm38. A counts matrix reporting the numbers of reads mapping to each gene was then generated, and abundance measurements performed using TMM-normalized (EdgeR) counts data to quantify gene expression levels. 14937 expressed transcripts were identified as expressed above a minimum threshold. Results from the transcriptomic analysis indicated that ChAdOx/MVA P1A vaccination had a profound effect on the gene expression profiles of 15V4T3 tumours. Approximately 1250 differentially expressed genes were identified in tumours from vaccinated compared to unvaccinated mice using a threshold for differential expression of fold change > 2 and Padj < 0.05. Furthermore, gene expression signatures corresponding to a CD8+ T-cell driven inflammatory response and an IFNg response were found to be highly enriched in tumours from vaccinated mice. Such gene expression signatures have been found in other studies to be predictive of response to immunotherapy and anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. GSVA further confirmed the enrichment of gene sets corresponding to immune activation, a pro-inflammatory response and T-cell activity in the mRNA expression data from tumours of vaccinated mice compared to unvaccinated. Taken together these findings show that a ChAdOx/MVA vaccine targeting a MAGE type antigen can generate and drive tumour gene expression patterns associated with a T-cell inflammatory response and positive response to cancer immunotherapy.

GSE181077	2021.07.31	Mus musculus	GPL13112	TRUE	FALSE	8	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Integrated transcriptomic and translatomic exploration of the effect of betaine on lipid metabolic dysregulation induced by a high-fat diet	An excessive high-fat/energy diet is a major cause of obesity and associated complications, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Betaine has been shown to effectively improve hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the mechanistic basis for this improvement is largely unknown. Herein, integration of transcriptomics sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome footprints profiling (Ribo-seq) was used to investigate the means by which betaine alleviates hepatic lipid metabolic disorders induced by a high-fat diet. For the transcriptome, gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated betaine to reduce liver steatosis by up-regulation of fatty acid beta oxidation, lipid oxidation, and fatty acid catabolic processes. For the translatome, 574 differentially expressed genes were identified, 17 of which were associated with the NAFLD pathway. By combined analysis of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq, we found that betaine had the greatest effect on NAFLD at the translational level. Further, betaine decreased translational efficiency (TE) for IDI1, CYP5A1, TM7SF2, and APOA4, which are related to lipid biosynthesis. In summary, this study demonstrates betaine to alleviate lipid metabolic dysfunction at the translational level. The powerful multi-omics data integration approach used herein provides for a new understanding of the means by which to treat NAFLD.		post natal week 25;high fat diet adding betaine (2percent w/v) from week 8;high fat diet from week 8;Liver;C57BL/6

The disease is most likely caused by the altered expression of a number of genes that function at the level of biological pathways or gene networks. Transcription factors (TF) are indispensable regulators of gene expression. EGR3 is a TF associated with schizophrenia. In the current study, DNA microarray and ingenuity pathway analyses (IPA) demonstrated that EGR3 regulates Reelin signaling pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. ChIP and luciferase reporter studies confirmed that EGR3 directly binds to the promoter region of RELN thereby activating RELN expression. Both the expression of EGR3 and RELN were decreased during neuronal differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA) in SH-SY5Y cells, and EGR3 overexpression reduced neurite outgrowth which could be partially reversed by the knockdown of RELN. The expression levels of EGR3 and RELN in peripheral blood of patients with schizophrenia were found to be downregulated (compared to healthy controls), and were positively correlated. Furthermore, data mining from public databases revealed that the expression levels of EGR3 and RELN were presented a positive correlation in postmortem brain tissue of schizophrenic individuals. Taken together, the current study suggests that EGR3 is a novel TF of the RELN gene and regulates neurite outgrowth via Reelin signaling pathway. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the regulatory role of EGR3 in the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of schizophrenia, and potentially to the development of new therapies and diagnostic biomarkers for the disorder.

Therapies specific to pediatric DCM remains limited due to lack of a disease model. Our previous study showed that treatment of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) with non-failing or DCM pediatric patient serum activates the fetal gene program (FGP). Here we show that serum treatment with Proteinase K prevents activation of the FGP, whereas RNase treatment exacerbates it, suggesting that circulating proteins, but not circulating microRNAs, promote these pathological changes. Evaluation of the protein secretome showed that midkine (MDK) is up-regulated in DCM serum, and NRVM treatment with MDK activates the FGP. Changes in gene expression in serum-treated NRVMs, evaluated by next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), indicates extracellular matrix remodeling and focal adhesion pathways are upregulated in pediatric DCM serum and serum-treated NRVMs, suggesting alterations in cellular stiffness. Cellular stiffness was evaluated by Atomic Force Microscopy, which showed an increase in stiffness in DCM serum-treated NRVMs. Of the proteins increased in DCM sera, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (sFRP1) was a potential candidate for the increase in cellular stiffness, and sFRP1 treatment of NRVMs recapitulated the increase in cellular stiffness observed in response to DCM-serum treatment. Our results show that serum circulating proteins promote pathological changes in gene expression and cellular stiffness, and circulating miRNAs are protective against pathological changes.		sprague dawley rats;post-natal 2 days;10+11;neonatal rat ventricular myocyte cells;8+9;28+29;30+31;32+33

Yet the spliceosome machinery is insufficient to fully specify splicing complexity. In considering the role of the epigenome in activity-dependent alternative splicing, we and others find the histone modification, H3K36me3, to be a putative splicing regulator. In the current study, we found that mouse cocaine self-administration caused widespread differential alternative splicing, concomitant with enrichment of H3K36me3 at differentially spliced junctions. Importantly, only targeted epigenetic editing can distinguish between a direct role of H3K36me3 in splicing and an indirect role via regulation of splice factor expression elsewhere on the genome. We targeted Srsf11, which was both alternatively spliced and H3K36me3 enriched in brain following cocaine self-administration. Results: Epigenetic editing of H3K36me3 at Srsf11 was sufficient to drive its alternative splicing and enhanced cocaine self-administration, establishing the direct causal relevance of H3K36me3 to alternative splicing of Srsf11 and to reward behavior.

GSE180984	2021.07.31	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	2	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			The SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro causes microvascular brain pathology by cleaving NEMO in brain endothelial cells	COVID-19 can damage cerebral small vessels and cause neurological symptoms. However, the vascular pathology and the potential mechanisms are unclear. In brains of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and animal models, we found an increased number of empty basement membrane tubes, so-called string vessels representing remnants of lost capillaries. We obtained evidence that brain endothelial cells are infected and that the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) cleaves NEMO, the essential modulator of NF-κB. By ablating NEMO, Mpro induces the death of human brain endothelial cells and the occurrence of string vessels in mice. Deletion of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3, a mediator of regulated cell death, blocks the vessel rarefaction and disruption of the blood-brain barrier due to NEMO ablation. Importantly, a pharmacological inhibitor of RIPK signaling prevented the Mpro-induced microvascular pathology. Our data suggest RIPK as a potential therapeutic target to treat the neuropathology of COVID-19.		10 weeks post natal;hypothalamus single cells;wild type;Hypothalamus;C57Bl/6N

Here we identified recurrent LMNA-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1 fusions in Korean patients with colon cancer (3 out of 147, 2%) through next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NTRK1 fusions were mutually exclusive oncogenic drivers of colon cancer that were accompanied with in vitro potential of colony formation and in vivo tumorigenicity comparable to KM12, a human colon cancer cell line harboring TPM3-NTRK1 fusion. NTRK1-encoded TrkA protein was prevalent in 11 out of 216 Korean (5.1%) and 28 out of 472 Chinese patients (5.9%) from independent cohorts, respectively. The expression level of TrkA was significantly correlated with NTRK1 fusion (p = 0.0192), which was verified by a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Korean patients with TrkA-positive colon cancer had a marginal but significant shorter overall survival time than TrkA-negative colon cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5346, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 0.2548-0.9722, p = 0.0411]. In addition, KM12 cell line was sensitive to selective TrkA inhibitors. These results demonstrate that NTRK1 fusion is granted as a clinically relevant target for therapeutic intervention of colon cancer.

While rhinoviruses (RV) typically cause little more than the common cold, they can produce severe infections and disease exacerbations in susceptible individuals, including those with chronic lung diseases. Variations in the regulation of key antiviral cytokines, particularly type I interferon (IFN-α and IFN-b), may contribute to RV susceptibility, but are not well understood. Method: Whole genome transcription patterns were assessed in samples from 74 individuals demonstrating high or low IFN-α production following RV stimulation in vitro. Results: In unstimulated samples (baseline) the high IFN-α producer group showed higher expression of genes associated with plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the complement system, B-cell chemokines, immune regulation, macrophages, and vitamin D activation and lower expression of genes linked to haemoglobin and haem biosynthesis, wound healing, stress response and pro-inflammatory genes than the low IFN-α producer group. After RV stimulation, the high IFN-α producer group showed more intense upregulation of diverse immune function genes including IFNs and greater downregulation of genes linked to structural and extra-cellular matrix functions than the low IFN-α producer group. Patterns of antibacterial gene expression varied between groups. Healthy people and those with asthma generally showed similar gene expression patterns. These findings highlight multiple biological pathways whose expression patterns differ substantially between high and low IFN-α producers. These differences likely contribute to variations in anti-RV immunity and immunopathology between individuals.

To get insights into both conserved and species-specific variations during early limb patterning and outgrowth, we leverage genome-wide comprehensive assessment of chromatin accessibility and transcriptional changes during mouse forelimb and chicken wing bud development. Our analysis reveals temporal modulation of chromatin accessibility and expression as well as their temporal relationship during the progression of mouse forelimb and chicken wing bud development. Transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis and putative TF occupancy as inferred by integrating TF binding motifs and chromatin accessibility information reveal temporal TF-DNA interactions during forelimb/wing bud patterning. Finally, the integration of accessibility, expression, and TF binding site information allowed to identify candidate gene targets of HAND2 and GLI3 that include conserved as well as species-specific transcriptional regulator-gene interactions.

GSE163424	2021.07.31	Homo sapiens	GPL16791	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Niraparib treatment of metastatic melanoma in vivo	Twenty four NSG mice (3 groups, 8 mice/group) were injected subcutaneoulsy with melanoma PDX cells (MM425X). When tumors reached 100mm3, daily i.p. injections of 25mg/kg niraparib were administred to the tumor bearing mice for 30 days. The treatment resulted in significant anti-tumor effects against MM425X. To determine the transcriptomic profiles altered following niraparib treatment, RNA-Seq was performed in MM-425 tumors from three mice treated with niraparib compared with three mice treated with vehicle. To that end, 3 tumors/group (vehicle vs Niraparib treated) were harvested for RNA extraction. RNA extraction from flash-frozen tissue samples was performed as previously described (Olsson et al., 2016, Salomonis et al., 2010, Soroceanu et al., 2013).

GSE155145	2021.07.31	Mus musculus	GPL11002	TRUE	FALSE	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			The effect of nicotine on RNA sequencing of mice spermatozoa	Our laboratory previous research confirmed that nicotine in cigarette smoke causes apoptosis in germ cells in the testis and it will increase the formation of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm of testicular stromal cells. In addition, nicotine, the main toxic substance in cigarette smoke, also affects telomerase activity of spermatogenic cells, shortens telomere length, and causes structural damage of chromosomes. It is worth noting that after nicotine treatment, the expression of proteins involved in cytoskeleton regulation and energy metabolism in mouse testis was significantly up-regulated, and the sperm motility of mice was improved after nicotine treatment. To investigate the underlying mechanism, C57BL/6J mice were divided into control and nicotine treated groups. Next generation RNA sequencing and bio-informatics analysis were carried out to analysis the effects of nicotine on the RNA profile of mice spermatozoa. The results of RNA-Seq showed that the number of reads in the control group was 2089729, and the number of reads in the nicotine-treated group was 1739093, and a total of 8699 transcripts were obtained. Expression level of some pathways remarkably changed after nicotine treatment.This experimental study are helpful to understand the mechanism of the effect of nicotine on sperm and help us to provide a way to study the effection of patern nicotine exposure on offspring development.		nicotine;spermatozoa;saline;C57BL/6J;adult

However, administration of additional nutrition or ED in oral cancer patients might also provide extra nutrition for cancer cells, which could result in cancer development. At present, it is still unclear whether the beneficial effect of ED can be expected to surpass its possible harmful effect on oral cancer treatment. In the present study, we tried to clarify whether Elental® has different effects on human oral keratinocyte (HOK) cells compared to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells (HSC2). Method: Gene expression profiles of HOK cells and HSC2 cells treated with Elental® were generated by deep sequencing. Results: Whole transcriptome analysis data suggested that Elental® helped in the proliferation and survival of HOK through the induction of ERK. Moreover, Elental® added stress to HSC2 through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress response marker, BiP. Our results showed that Elental® might add stress to HSC2, and provide growth stimulation to HOK. Conclusion: Whole transcriptome analysis showed different gene expression profile between HOK cells and HSC2 cells treated with Elental®, suggesting that effects of Elental® might differ between normal oral cells and oral cancer cells.		5 microg/ml of Elental;3 hours;oral squamous cell carcinoma cells;human oral keratinocyte cells;human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells;12 hours;0.5 hours;0 hours

We used cortical organoids derived from ASD cases to investigate neurodevelopmental pathways dysregulated by dosage changes of 16p11.2 CNV. We show that organoids recapitulate patients’ macrocephaly and microcephaly phenotypes. Deletions and duplications have “mirror” effects on cell proliferation, maturation and synapse number, consistent with “mirror” effects on brain development in humans. Neuronal migration was decreased in both, deletion and duplication organoids. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed synaptic defects and neuronal migration as key drivers of 16p11.2 functional effect. We implicate upregulation of small GTPase RhoA involved in regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, neuron migration and neurite outgrowth as one of the pathways impacted by the 16p11.2 CNV in ASD. Treatment with the RhoA inhibitor Rhosin rescued neuron migration, but not synaptic defects. This study identifies pathways dysregulated by the 16p11.2 CNV during early neocortical development using cortical organoid models.

In rare patients, HPV-2 may cause striking “tree man” manifestations. We describe here a patient with the HPV-2-driven “tree man” phenotype, and two of his distant relatives with unusually severe HPV4-driven warts. Genetic, transcriptional, and histological analyses of the “tree man” lesions showed that they formed a multifocal benign epithelial tumor driven by a specific HPV-2 strain. Surprisingly, all three patients are homozygous for a mutation of an essential splice site in the CD28 gene, which encodes an activating surface receptor on T cells. They have no detectable CD28 on their T cells, which, with the exception of a small contingent of revertant memory CD4+ T cells, do not respond to CD28 stimulation.

T- and B-cell development, and responses to antigens are otherwise normal in these individuals. Finally, CD28-deficient mice are vulnerable to cutaneous infections with the μ-papillomavirus MmuPV1.

Children of mothers with GDM are at an increased risk for the development of cardiometabolic disease later in life, though the mechanisms responsible for this observation are unknown. We propose that an altered cardiac transcriptome, programmed in utero, may be a contributing mechanism to cardiometabolic disease development and hypothesize that the hearts of offspring exposed to GDM will exhibit altered gene expression pathways. The purpose of this project will be to study alterations in the cardiac transcriptome of young adult rat offspring after exposure to GDM to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the developmental origins of cardiovascular disease.

GSE136242	2021.07.31	Mus musculus	GPL21103	TRUE	FALSE	4	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Reduced basal insulin secretion from islets isolated from tafazzin deficient mice is associated with reduced mitochondrial function	Tafazzin is a transacylase which causes the content and molecular structure of cardiolipin (CL) to be altered in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The enzymatic machinery responsible for oxidative respiration are localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and require CL for activity. As a result, tafazzin is critical for maintaining mitochondrial function. In beta-cells, which are the insulin secreting cells in pancreatic islets, mitochondrial function is linked to insulin secretion. We previously established that tafazzin knock-down mice were lean and maintained insulin sensitivity compared to the obese insulin resistant control litter mates. However, it was unknown whether tafazzin deficiency also influenced insulin secretion in the establishment of the lean phenotype. Using X week-old mice, we ascertained that the number of beta-cells was similar between genotypes. Ex vivo insulin secretion under low glucose conditions was reduced (52%) from islets isolated from tafazzin knock-down mice. Consistent with this tafazzin knock-down mice exhibited reduced fasting insulin plasma insulin levels. Measurement of mitochondrial oxygen consumption revealed that basal oxygen consumption was reduced (58%) in islets from tafazzin-deficient animals. The addition of etomoxir, an inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid translocation, significantly elevated basal mitochondrial respiration (5-fold) in islets from tafazzin knockdown mice, indicating a significant fatty acid-mediated inhibitory effect. In contrast, etomoxir lacked any measurable effect on control wild-type islets. The altered mitochondrial function identified in taffazin knock-down islets was not associated with reduced CL content or elevated oxyCL species. Our experiments indicate that tafazzin plays a key role in regulating normal islet beta-cell function.		pancreas;islets;non-transgenic control;Tafazzin-knockdown;male
GSE181153	2021.07.30	Homo sapiens	GPL18573	TRUE	FALSE	66	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Synthetic amyloid beta does not induce a robust transcriptional response in innate immune cell culture systems	Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impacts nearly 400 million people worldwide. The accumulation of Amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain has historically been associated with AD, and recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a central role in its origin and progression. The combination of these observations has led to the proposal of Aβ as the main trigger to induce the proinflammatory activation of immune brain cells that culminates in neuronal damage and cognitive decline. In order to test this hypothesis, many in vitro systems have been established to study Aβ-mediated activation of innate immune cells. Nevertheless, the resemblance of these models to the AD brain has never been comprehensively studied on a genome-wide scale. To address this, we used bulk RNA-seq to assess the transcriptional differences between in vitro cell types used to model AD and its similarities to primary brain immune cells. We then analysed the transcriptional response of different innate immune cells to synthetic Aβ. We found that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived microglia (IMGL) is the in vitro cell model that best resembles primary microglia, but surprisingly, synthetic Aβ does not trigger a robust transcriptional response in any of the cellular models analysed, even when different formulations and concentrations of Aβ were employed. Finally we found that the alternative use of bacterial LPS and INF to activate the inflammasome in microglia, induces the transcription of genes that are also elevated in disease associated microglia present in the AD brain suggesting the suitability of this model to study AD-related neuroinflammation.		24hr PBS;iPSC-derived microglia;24hr 1 uM oA[beta] (Method A: Abud, 2017);24hr 1 uM oA[beta] (Method B: Tseng et al. 2017), 10 ng/mL LPS, 20 ng/mL IFN-gamma;24hr 1 uM 5-day fAβ (Method A: Abud, 2017);24hr 5 uM oA[beta] (Method B: Tseng et al. 2017);No treatment;iPSC-derived hematopoetic progenitor cells;Differentiated from iPSCs using STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit; collected in medium B;10% FBS;HMC3 microglia cell line;RPMI, 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep; differentiated to macrophages with PMA for Z hr;induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC);24hr 10 uM oA[beta] (Method B: Tseng et al. 2017);24hr 10 ng/mL LPS, 20 ng/mL IFN-gamma;Differentiated from iPSC-derived HPCs using STEMdiff microglia Differentiation/Maturation Kits; treated/collected in Microglia Maturation Media;24hr 1 uM oA[beta] (Method B: Tseng et al. 2017);24hr 1 uM 7-day fAβ (Method A: Abud, 2017);Differentiated from iPSC-derived HPCs using STEMdiff microglia Differntiation/Maturation Kits; treated/collected in Microglia Matuation Media;RPMI, 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep; differentiated to macrophages with 24hr of 25 uM PMA, then 72hr of rest;EMEM, 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep;Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs);4hr PBS;U87 astrocyte cell line;THP-1 monocyte cell line;24hr 1 uM fAβ (Method B: Tseng et al. 2017);DMEM, 10% FBS; differentiated to macrophages with 5d of 15 ng/mL rhGM-CSF;mTeSR1, 0.5 mM EDTA;None;4hr 1 uM oA[beta] (Method B: Tseng et al. 2017)

The goal of this study is to identify alteration of gene expression in human osteochondromas in response to identify nontreated or RARg agonist-treated osteochondorma transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) and to evaluate the actions of RARg agonists on osteochondromas. Methods: Osteochondroma mRNA profiles of untreated or RARg agonist treated (4 days) osteochondroma explants were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 4000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results and Conclusions: Our study represents the detailed analysis of human osteochondromas, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome revealed that RARg agonists acts on human osteochondromas and altered various types of biological functions.

In the mouse blastocyst, cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) coexpress NANOG and GATA6, two TFs that drive the bifurcation of these progenitors into either the epiblast (Epi) or the primitive endoderm (PrE), respectively. Here, using in vitro differentiation, we describe the molecular mechanisms of how GATA6 quickly induces the PrE fate while repressing the Epi lineage. GATA6 functions as a pioneer TF by inducing nucleosome repositioning at regulatory elements controlling PrE genes, making them accessible for deposition of active histone marks and leading to rewiring of chromatin interactions and ultimately transcriptional activation. GATA6 also binds most regulatory elements of Epi genes followed by eviction of the Epi-specific TFs NANOG and SOX2, loss of active histone marks, and reduction in chromatin accessibility that culminates in transcriptional repression. Unexpectedly, evicted NANOG and SOX2 transiently bind PrE regulatory elements occupied by GATA6. Our study shows that GATA6 binds and modulate the same regulatory elements as Epi TFs, a phenomenon we also validated in blastocysts. We propose that the ability of PrE and Epi-specific TFs to extensively bind and regulate the same gene networks contributes to ICM plasticity and allows rapid cell lineage specification by coordinating both activation and repression of divergent transcriptional programs.

This novel approach features simple one-pot synthesis of chiral flavan-3-ols containing two vicinal stereogenic centers via a highly efficient kinetic resolution pathway (s factor up to 1060, >99% ee for most substrates and products, exclusively trans products). In addition, the anti-inflammation effects of these diversified flavan-3-ols have been further studied by the in vitro experiments and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. The modified flavan-3-ol natural product derivatives showed inhibitory effects on the expression and secretion of pro-inflammation cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, as well as inhibiting the inflammation responses through downregulating the gene transcriptions closely related to IL-17 signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway, which suggest these newly synthesized compounds are potent lead compounds for treating inflammation diseases.

This implies a diverse host immune response to SARS-CoV-2. However, the immunological underpinnings underlying these divergent disease courses remain elusive. We therefore set out to longitudinally characterize immune signatures of convalescent COVID-19 patients stratified according to their disease severity. Our unique convalescent COVID-19 cohort consists of 74 patients not confounded by comorbidities. This is the first study of which we are aware that excludes immune abrogations associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 related risk factors of disease severity. Patients were followed up and analyzed longitudinally (2, 4 and 6 weeks after infection) by high-dimensional flow cytometric profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in-depth serum analytics, and transcriptomics. Immune phenotypes were correlated to disease severity. Convalescence was overall associated with uniform immune signatures, but distinct immune signatures for mildly versus severely affected patients were detectable within a 2-week time window after infection.

Alternatively activated macrophages are involved in diverse pathophysiological processes such as confining tissue parasites2, improving insulin sensitivity3 or promoting an immune tolerant microenvironment that facilitates tumour growth and metastasis4. Recently, the role of metabolism in the regulation of macrophage function has come into focus as both the classical and alternative activation programmes require specific regulated metabolic reprogramming5. While most of the studies regarding immunometabolism have focussed on the catabolic pathways activated to provide energy, little is known about the anabolic pathways mediating macrophage alternative activation. In this study, we show that the anabolic transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) is activated in response to the canonical Th2 cytokine interleukin 4 (IL-4) to trigger the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) programme, as a necessary step for macrophage alternative activation. Mechanistically, DNL consumes NADPH, partitioning it away from cellular antioxidant defences and raising ROS levels. ROS serves as a second messenger, signalling sufficient DNL, and promoting macrophage alternative activation. The pathophysiological relevance of this mechanism is validated by showing that SREBP1/DNL is essential for macrophage alternative activation in vivo in a helminth infection model.		14_ 161_C;7_ 1_IL4;15_ 163_C;LysM+/Cre SCAPfl/fl;1_ 1_C;23_ 162_IL4;Bone Marrow derived Macrophages;20_ 161_IL4;Control;8_ 2_IL4;Batch 1;17_ 162_C;5_ 54_C;18_ 165_C;Batch 2;2_ 2_C;4_ 45_C;9_ 3_IL4;IL-4;11_ 54_IL4;12_ 57_IL4;24_ 165_IL4;3_ 3_C;LysM+/+ SCAPfl/fl;6_ 57_C;21_ 163_IL4;22_ 156_IL4;19_ 157_IL4;10_ 45_IL4;13_ 157_C;16_ 156_C

B cell differentiation and the subsequent release of class-switched immunoglobulins have been speculated to occur in the meninges, but the exact cellular composition and underlying mechanisms of meningeal-dominated inflammation remain unknown. Here, we performed in depth characterization of meningeal vs. parenchymal Th17-induced rodent neuroinflammation. The most pronounced cellular and transcriptional differences between these compartments was the localization of B cells exhibiting a follicular phenotype exclusively to the meninges. Correspondingly, meningeal but not parenchymal Th17 cells, acquired a B cell-supporting phenotype and resided in close contact with B cells. This preferential B cell tropism for the meninges and the formation of meningeal ectopic lymphoid tissue was partially dependent on the expression of the transcription factor Bcl6 in Th17 cells, that is required in other T cell lineages to induce isotype class-switching in B cells. A function of Bcl6 in Th17 cells was only detected in vivo and was reflected by the induction of B cell-supporting cytokines, the appearance of follicular B cells in the meninges, and of immunoglobulin class-switching in the CSF. We, thus, identify the induction of a B cell-supporting meningeal microenvironment by Bcl6 in Th17 cells as a novel mechanism controlling compartment-specificity in neuroinflammation.		bulk-RNA seq data of Bcl6KO-Th17 cells from SC parenchyma of AT-EAE recipient;adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis;Bcl6KO-R SC parenchmya-derived leukocytes;Bcl6KO-R SC meninges-derived leukocytes;2D2tg CD4cre Bcl6flox (=Bcl6KO);wt-R SC meninges-derived leukocytes;wt-R SC meninges-derived sorted VBeta11+ CD4+ T cells;2D2tg (=wt);TCR seq data of SC parenchyma of AT-EAE recipients of Bcl6KO-Th17 cells;bulk-RNA seq data of wt-Th17 cells from SC parenchyma of AT-EAE recipient;in vitro Th17-wt culture-derived sorted VBeta11+ CD4+ T cells;in vitro Th17-Bcl6KO culture-derived sorted VBeta11+ CD4+ T cells;Bcl6KO-R SC parenchyma-derived sorted VBeta11+ CD4+ T cells;bulk-RNA seq data of in vitro differentiated Bcl6KO-Th17 cells;wt-R SC parenchyma-derived leukocytes;Bcl6KO-R SC meninges-derived sorted VBeta11+ CD4+ T cells;bulk-RNA seq data of wt-Th17 cells from SC meninges of AT-EAE recipient;donor: 2D2tg CD4cre Bcl6flox (=Bcl6KO), recipient: C57BL/6;single-cell RNA seq data of SC meninges of AT-EAE recipients of Bcl6KO-Th17 cells;TCR seq data of SC meninges of AT-EAE recipients of Bcl6KO-Th17 cells;wt-R SC parenchyma-derived sorted VBeta11+ CD4+ T cells;TCR seq data of SC parenchyma of AT-EAE recipients of wt-Th17 cells;bulk-RNA seq data of in vitro differentiated wt-Th17 cells;donor: 2D2tg (=wt), recipient: C57BL/6;single-cell RNA seq data of SC parenchyma of AT-EAE recipients of Bcl6KO-Th17 cells;bulk-RNA seq data of Bcl6KO-Th17 cells from SC meninges of AT-EAE recipient;RNA expression;in vitro Th17 differentiation (pre-AT-EAE transfer);single-cell RNA seq data of SC meninges of AT-EAE recipients of wt-Th17 cells;TCR seq data of SC meninges of AT-EAE recipients of wt-Th17 cells;single-cell RNA seq data of SC parenchyma of AT-EAE recipients of wt-Th17 cells

Analysis of longitudinal specimens enables understanding of how host immune pressures drive viral evolution in vivo. Here we performed sequencing of 49 longitudinal SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from 20 patients in Washington State collected between March and September of 2020. Viral loads declined over time with an average increase in RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of 0.87 per day. We found that there was negligible change in SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences over time, but identified a number of nonsynonymous variants at low frequencies across the genome. We observed enrichment for a relatively small number of these variants, all of which are now seen in consensus genomes across the globe at low prevalence. In one patient, we saw rapid emergence of various low-level deletion variants at the N-terminal domain of the spike glycoprotein, some of which have previously been shown to be associated with reduced neutralization potency from sera. In a subset of samples that were sequenced using metagenomic methods, differential gene expression analysis showed a downregulation of cytoskeletal genes that was consistent with a loss of ciliated epithelium during infection and recovery. We also identified co-occurrence of bacterial species in samples from multiple hospitalized individuals. These results demonstrate that the intrahost genetic composition of SARS-CoV-2 is dynamic during the course of COVID-19, and highlight the need for continued surveillance and deep sequencing of minor variants.

The most common variant of CTCL, Mycosis Fungoides, is confined to the skin in early stages but can be accompanied by extracutaneous dissemination of malignant T cells to the blood and lymph nodes in advanced stages of disease. Sézary Syndrome, a leukemic form of disease is characterized by significant blood involvement. Little is known about the transcriptional and genomic relationship between skin and blood residing malignant T cells in CTCL. In the present study we interrogate multiple modalities of information in single cells from matched skin and blood samples of patients with leukemic disease and healthy controls within a single workflow. By employing expanded CRISPR-compatible cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (ECCITE-seq), we sought to compare the molecular profile of malignant clones residing in the skin and circulation of these patients across gene and protein expression modalities. We apply inferred CNV and phylogenetic analysis to examine sub-clonal heterogeneity to gain insights into the evolution and the relationship of malignant clones across tissues. Our data reveals clonal evolution at a transcriptional and genetic level within the malignant populations of individual patients. We highlight highly consistent transcriptional signatures delineating skin-derived and blood-derived malignant T cells. Analysis of these two populations suggests that environmental cues, along with genetic aberrations, contribute to transcriptional profiles of malignant T cells.

We show here that microglia from aged mice upregulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 signaling regulating translation, as well as cytokine protein levels. Genetic ablation of mTOR signaling showed a dual, yet contrasting effect on microglia priming: it caused an NF-kB-dependent upregulation of priming genes at mRNA level; however, mice displayed reduced cytokine protein levels, diminished microglia activation and milder sickness behavior. The effect on translation was dependent on reduced phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and increased 4EBP1 expression, resulting in decreased binding of EIF4E to EIF4G. Similar changes were present in aged human microglia and in damage-associated microglia, indicating upregulation of mTOR-dependent translation is an essential step licensing microglia priming in ageing and neurodegeneration.

Evidence suggests the microenvironment as a possible source of soluble factors mediating neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), but molecular mechanisms are unknown. Using a transgenic mouse model we show that upon castration tumor cells up-regulate GRP78, which triggers a cascade leading to down-regulation of the matricellular protein SPARC in the nearby stroma. SPARC loss allows stroma cells to release IL-6, a known inducer of NED. A drug targeting GRP78 blocks NED in castrated mice. These events find correlation in prostate cancer patients developing focal NED after androgen deprivation therapies.

We previously showed that each AML sub-type displays a different gene regulatory network with specific transcription factor families playing distinct roles in maintaining the leukemic phenotype. Here we show that the transcription factor WT1 forms a major node in the gene regulatory networks of multiple AML sub-types. It is frequently mutated and up-regulated in AML and its expression is pedictive for relapse. The WT1 protein exists as different isoforms which we show here to harbor differential chromatin binding and contrasting biological activity, including directing differential splicing. For two main AML subtypes we demonstrate that WT1 responds to oncogenic signaling and is part of a signaling-responsive transcription factor hub that controls AML growth. WT1 therefore plays a central and wide-spread role in AML biology.

Inhibition of mTOR in cardiomyocytes is protective, however, a detailed role of mTOR in translational regulation of specific mRNA networks in the diseased heart is largely unknown. A cardiomyocyte genome-wide sequencing approach was used to define mTOR-dependent post-transcriptional gene expression control at the level of mRNA translation. This approach identified the muscle specific protein Cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 2 (Cand2) as a translationally upregulated gene dependent on the activity of mTOR. Deletion of Cand2 protects the myocardium against pathological remodeling. Mechanistically, we found that Cand2 links mTOR- signaling to pathological cell growth by increasing Grk5 protein expression. Our data suggest that cell-type specific targeting of mTOR might have therapeutic value for adverse pathological cardiac remodeling.		KO;left ventricle;WT;C57BL/6;heart

MALAT1 targeting by gapmerization reduced expression of some tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes including the malic enzyme 3 and the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases 1 and 3 as well as the choline kinase A. In consequence, prostate cancer metabolism switched toward a glycolytic phenotype characterized by increased lactate production paralleled by growth arrest, and cell death. Conversely, the function of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase and expression of oxphos enzymes was markedly reduced, suggesting for a decreased tricarboxylic acid cycle and mitochondrial respiration activity. Interestingly, a similar effect was observed in several prostate cancer-derived organotypic slice cultures, in which metabolism became more glycolytic and apoptotic. Based on these observations, we elaborated a predictive algorithm, in which those metabolic enzymes sensitive to MALAT1 targeting proven successfully to predict tumor recurrence in a subset of patients. In summary, MALAT1 targeting by gapmerization activates a metabolic switch in the prostate cancer cell and tumor tissue unraveling a role for crucial metabolic enzymes in tumor progression and outcome.

We investigated whether maternal exercise during gestation alone could protect the offspring from the adverse effects of either maternal or paternal obesity induced by high-fat diet (HFD). To understand the underlying mechanisms we performed transcriptomics, whole-genome DNA methylation and targeted DNA methylation analysis at the metabolic master regulator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g coactivator-1a (Pgc-1a) promoter in the adult offspring skeletal muscle. Both maternal and paternal HFD resulted in impaired glucose tolerance in the offspring at 9 months of age. Maternal exercise during gestation completely mitigated this metabolic impairment induced by either maternal or paternal HFD. Adult offspring exposed to either maternal or paternal HFD without exercise during gestation had skeletal muscle transcriptional profiles enriched in genes regulating inflammation and immune responses, whereas maternal exercise resulted in a transcriptional profile that was more similar to control offspring from normal chow fed parents. Changes in promoter and CpG DNA methylation were detected between the groups but did not explain the transcriptional changes. Maternal HFD increased methylation of the Pgc-1α promoter at CpG -260, which was prevented by maternal exercise. Paternal HFD did not affect the methylation of the Pgc-1α promoter. These findings demonstrate the negative consequences of maternal and paternal obesity for the offspring’s metabolic outcomes later in life and the clear benefits of maternal exercise during gestation. The mechanisms involve transcriptional regulation of skeletal muscle likely through multiple types of epigenetic modifications.		MP;normal chow;MHE;PHE;M;P;Sed;Ex;high-fat diet;Quadricep;MHS;PHS;NCS

The majority of OPSCC positive for HPV infection is associated with better prognosis, but a fraction of them, similarly to HPV-negative ones, is resistant to therapy and has poor prognosis. A deep molecular study of OPSCC is mandatory to identify either prognostic markers or targets for therapy, in particular in patients with worse prognosis. Methods: 14 HPV-positive and 15 HPV-negative Italian OPSCC (n=29) with complete clinical information and follow-up of more than 5 years were molecularly characterized by gene expression profiling and compared to three cohorts of OPSCC extracted from public HNSCC datasets. AKR1C3 emerged as robust marker overexpressed in HPV-negative OPSCC and in HPV-positive lesions with worse prognosis. Fadu and Cal-27 OPSCC cell lines were treated with AKR1C3 inhibitors, alone or in combination with Cisplatin. Results: Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that up-regulated genes in HPV-positive samples are involved in immune system, muscle related processes, response to stimuli, actin organization, tissue development and adhesion, while down-regulated genes participated in glutathione derivative biosynthetic and xenobiotic metabolic processes, hypoxia and oxidative stress. AKR1C3, coding for an enzyme involved in chemio-radioresistance, is in the top10 genes with higher upregulation in HPV-negative samples. Pre-treatment with a selective AKR1C3 inhibitor potentiated the effect of Cisplatin in cells with higher basal level of the enzyme. Conclusions: We identified a druggable target, AKR1C3, associated with survival in subgroups of OPSCC patients either positive or negative for HPV infection and to resistance to chemo-radiotherapy in HNSCC. Pretreatment of OPSCC cell lines expressing this enzyme with a selective AKR1C3 inhibitor is able to enhance Cisplatin efficacy.

PD-1 is also transiently induced to high concentrations during priming of acute infections and immunizations, yet its impact on the development of long-lived antigen-independent T cell memory remains unclear. In addition to its expected role in restraining clonal effector expansion, here we show that PD-1 expression on antigen-specific CD8 T cells is required for the development of a durable CD8 T cell memory pool after antigen clearance. Loss of T cell-specific PD-1 signaling led to increased contraction and a defect in antigen-independent renewal of memory CD8 T cells in response to homeostatic cytokine signals, thus resulting in attrition of the memory pool over time. Whereas exhausted CD8 T cells regain function after PD-1 checkpoint blockade during chronic viral infection, the pre-existing pool of resting functional bystander memory CD8 T cells established in response to a previously administered immunogen decreased. Metabolically, PD-1 signals were necessary for regulating the critical balance of mTOR-dependent anabolic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation programs to meet the bioenergetics needs of quiescent memory. These results define PD-1 as a key metabolic regulator of protective T cell immunity. Further, these results have potential clinical implications for pre-existing CD8 T cell memory during PD-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. We used genomewide microarrays to analyze the mRNA gene expression profile of LCMV GP33-specific effector CD8 T cells from P14 mice that were differentiated in the presence (WT) or absence of PD1 signals (PD1KO) upon in vivo infection with LCMV Armstrong.

SHP2 plays critical roles in normal cell signaling; hence, SHP2is could influence the tumor microenvironment. We found that SHP2i treatment depleted alveolar and M2-like macrophages, induced tumor-intrinsic CCL5/CXCL10 secretion and promoted B and T lymphocyte infiltration in Kras- and Egfr- mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, treatment also increased intratumor gMDSCs via tumor-intrinsic, NF-kB-dependent production of CXCR2 ligands. Other RAS/ERK pathway inhibitors also induced CXCR2 ligands and gMDSC influx in mice, and CXCR2 ligands were induced in tumors from patients on KRASG12C-inhibitor trials. Combined SHP2(SHP099)/CXCR1/2(SX682) inhibition depleted a specific cluster of S100a8/9high gMDSCs, generated Klrg1+ CD8+ effector T cells with a strong cytotoxic phenotype but expressing the checkpoint receptor NKG2A, and enhanced survival in Kras- and Egfr-mutant models.

Thus, the functional defects in adipose ILC2 during aging drive thermogenic failure.		sorted ILC2;ILC2;visceral adipose tissue (VAT);old;adult;C57BL/6

Antigen presenting cells (APC) promote TRM cell differentiation and re-activation but have not been implicated in sustaining TRM cell responses. Here, we identified a novel role for dendritic cells in supporting tissue resident memory to melanoma. We showed that CD8 TRM cells remain in close proximity to dendritic cells in the skin. Depletion of CD11c+ cells results in rapid disaggregation and eventual loss of melanoma-specific TRM cells. Additionally, we determined that TRM migration and/or persistence requires chemotaxis and adhesion mediated by the CXCR6/CXCL16 axis. The interaction between CXCR6-expressing TRM cells and CXCL16-expressing APCs was found to be critical for sustaining TRM cell-mediated tumor protection. These findings substantially expand our knowledge of APC functions in tissue resident memory T cell homeostasis and longevity.		40 days post tumor resection;Skin;C57BL/6;lymphocyte

Meanwhile, AMPK concurrently phosphorylates PHGDH-Ser55 and selectively increases PHGDH catalytic activity against malate oxidation, thus pushing the reduction of NAD+ towards NADH generation. In the nucleus, the altered PHGDH activity positively regulates NADH/NAD+ ratio and thus restricts NAD+ level, and thereby leads to repression of NAD+-dependent PARP1 activity. Moreover, PHGDH is found to be associated with Ser73-phosphorylated c-Jun and specifically inhibits PARP1-mediated c-Jun poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which accordingly led to the impaired c-Jun transcriptional activity against genes expression linking to cell growth inhibition.

GSE179417	2021.07.29	Mus musculus	GPL17791	TRUE	TRUE	37	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			CXCL1: A new diagnostic biomarker for human tuberculosis discovered using Diversity Outbred mice	More humans have died of tuberculosis (TB) than any other infectious disease and millions still die each year. Experts advocate for blood-based, protein biomarkers to help diagnosis TB, which is critical in high-burden countries. However, the protein biomarker pipeline is small. Here, we used the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to address this gap, identifying five protein biomarker candidates. One biomarker, serum CXCL1, met the World Health Organization’s Targeted Product Profile for a triage test to diagnose active TB from latent M.tb infection (LTBI), non-TB lung disease, and normal sera in HIV-negative, adults from South Africa and Vietnam. To find the biomarker candidates, we quantified seven immune mediators and four proteins corresponding to a subset of highly expressed genes unique to progressor DO mice. Next, we applied statistical and machine learning methods to the data, i.e., 11 proteins in lungs from 453 infected and 29 non-infected mice. After searching all combinations of five algorithms and 239 protein subsets, validating, and testing the findings on independent data, two combinations accurately diagnosed progressor DO mice: Logistic Regression using MMP8; and Gradient Tree Boosting using a panel of 4: CXCL1, CXCL2, TNF, IL-10. Of those five protein biomarker candidates, two (MMP8 and CXCL1) were crucial for classifying DO mice; were above the limit of detection in most human serum samples; and had not been widely assessed for diagnostic performance in humans before. In patient sera, CXCL1 exceeded the triage diagnostic test criteria (>90% sensitivity; >70% specificity), while MMP8 did not. Using Area Under the Curve analyses, CXCL1 averaged 94.5% sensitivity and 88.8% specificity for active pulmonary TB (ATB) vs LTBI; 90.9% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity for ATB vs non-TB; and 100.0% sensitivity and 98.4% specificity for ATB vs normal sera. Our findings overall show that the DO mouse population can discover diagnostic-quality, serum protein biomarkers of human TB.		controller;progressor;non-infected;lung homogenate

Here we identify a pattern of imbalance marked by basal epithelial cell growth and differentiation that replaces normal airspaces in a mouse model of progressive post-viral lung disease due to Sendai virus. Single-cell and lineage-tracing technologies identify a distinct subset of basal epithelial stem cells (basal- ESCs) that extend into gas-exchange tissue to form long-term bronchiolar-alveolar remodeling regions. Moreover, this cell subset is selectively expanded by crossing a cell growth and survival checkpoint linked to the nuclear-localized alarmin IL-33 that is independent of IL-33-receptor signaling and instead connected to autocrine chromatin accessibility. This mechanism creates an activated stem-progenitor cell lineage with potential for physiological or pathological function. Thus, conditional loss of Il33 gene function in basal epithelial cells disrupts homeostasis of the epithelial barrier at skin and gut sites but also markedly attenuates post-viral disease in the lung based on down-regulation of remodeling and inflammation. We thereby identify a basal-ESC strategy to deploy innate-immune machinery that appears to overshoot the primordial goal of self- defense. The findings reveal new targets to stratify and correct chronic and often deadly post-viral disease.

Double knock-out mice show a significant increase in medulloblastoma frequency and hyperplastic EGL lesions formed by preneoplastic GCPs.

We discovered loss-of-function variants in the X-linked ETS transcription factor gene ELF4 in multiple unrelated male patients with early-onset mucosal autoinflammation and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characteristics including fevers and ulcers that responded to IL-1, TNF, or IL-12p40 blockade. Using cells from patients and two newly generated mouse models, we uncovered hyperinflammatory responses of ELF4-mutant macrophages to a range of innate stimuli. Mechanistically, Elf4 in macrophages both sustained expression of anti-inflammatory genes such as Il1rn and limited upregulation of inflammation amplifiers, including S100A8, Lcn2, Trem1, and neutrophil chemoattractants. Indeed, therapeutic Trem1 blockade reversed inflammation and intestine pathology in Elf4-mutant mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide in vivo. Thus, the ELF4 transcription factor restrains inflammation and protects against mucosal disease, a discovery with broad translational relevance for human inflammatory diseases such as IBD.

To understand how this pathogenic variant affects the nervous system, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into excitatory neurons with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function from MELAS patients with the m.3243A>G pathogenic variant. We combined micro-electrode array (MEA) measurements with RNA sequencing (MEA-seq) and found reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and presynaptic function, as well as non-cell autonomous processes in co-cultured astrocytes. Finally, we show that the clinical phase II drug sonlicromanol can improve neuronal network activity when treatment is initiated early in development. This was intricately linked with changes in the neuronal transcriptome. Overall, we provide insight in transcriptomic changes in iPSC-derived neurons with high m.3243A>G heteroplasmy, and show the pathology is partially reversible by sonlicromanol.		untreated;high (66%) m.3243A>G heteroplasmy (HH);low (0%) m.3243A>G heteroplasmy (LH);iNeurons (co-cultured with rat astrocytes);iPSC-derived neurons;healthy;sonlicromanol from DIV3;high (61%) m.3243A>G heteroplasmy (HH);MELAS

We created a disease map of genes involved in eye disorders across cells of posterior and anterior compartments of eye. We also probed the regulons of different cell populations, which included transcription factors (TFs) and receptor-ligand interactions and reveal unique directional signalling and cross-talks between ocular cell-types. Such regulons were checked for conservation across vertebrates including human, mouse, pig, zebrafish, and non-human primates to identify common core factors. Finally, we focused on one such transcription factor KLF7, which was conserved across species. After perturbing KLF7 gene expression during retinal ganglion cells (RGC) differentiation from human embryonic stem cells, we conclude that KLF7 plays a major role in maturation of RGC cells during differentiation.

After validating this technique by identifying clinically relevant EGFR resistance mutations, we applied this technique to two additional anti-cancer drugs, imatinib and AMG 510. We find novel deletions in BCR-ABL1 that confer resistance to BCR-ABL1 inhibitors and point mutations in the AMG 510 binding pocket or oncogenic non-G12C mutations, in KRAS-G12C or wild-type KRAS, respectively, that confer resistance to AMG 510.

To examine the toxicity, we monitored genome-wide gene expression changes in human lung BEAS-2B cells, exposed for 4h and 24h to a subtoxic dose of each PM extract. After 4h exposure, numerous dysregulated genes and processes such as oxidative stress, lipid and steroid metabolism, PPARα signaling and immune response, were found to be common for both extract treatments. Twenty four hour exposure resulted in more distinctive gene expression patterns. Although several common modulated processes indicating the metabolism of PAHs and activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) were identified, E15 specifically dysregulated a variety of other genes and pathways related to cancer promotion and progression, possibly due to the increased PAH content in PM organic extract.		lung;organic extract of non-exposed filter;organic extract of PM from E15;organic extract of PM from E0;epithelial cells;BEAS-2B;lung epithelial cells

We identified Nox4 as the major ROS generating enzyme whose expression is induced during differentiation of embryoid body (EB) into cells of all three germ layers. The role of Nox4 was examined using iPS cells generated from Nox4 -/- mouse. Differentiation markers showed significantly reduced expression levels consistent with the importance of Nox4-generated ROS during this process. From transcriptomic analyses, we found insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a member of a gene family extensively involved in embryonic development, as one of the most down-regulated genes. Indeed, addition of IGF2 to culture partly restored the differentiation efficiency of Nox4-/- iPS cells. Our results reveal an important signaling axis mediated by ROS in control of crucial events during differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.

Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs available that slow NASH progression or address NASH liver involvement in COVID-19. Since animal models cannot fully recapitulate human NASH, we hypothesized that stem cells isolated directly from end-stage NASH patient liver may address current knowledge gaps in human NASH pathology. Approach and Results: We devised methods allowing derivation, proliferation, hepatic differentiation and extensive characterization of bipotent ductal organoids from irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver. The transcriptomes of organoids derived from NASH liver, but not healthy liver show significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory and cytochrome p450-related pathways, as well as of known liver fibrosis and tumor markers, with the degree of upregulation being NASH patient-specific.		total RNA isolated by TRIZOL procedure;direct RNA isolation from liver;FDD healthy female  liver,  living donor;NASH5 female liver explant;MLD healthy male  liver,  living donor;NASH 2 male  liver explant;cirrhotic NASH human liver;NASH1 male liver explant;NASH6 male  liver explant;NASH explant liver;CF cystic fibropsis female liver explant;12d hepatic differentiation of biliary organoids;cystic fibropsis human liver;FDD healthy female  liver,  deceased donor;NASH5 female  liver explant;alcoholic cirrhosis  human liver;AC alcoholic cirrhosis  female liver explant;NASH3 male  liver explant;hepatic organoids;FDD healthy female  liver, deceased donor;NASH4 male  liver explant;female;male;healthy human liver

It remains unclear how keratinocytes process physiologic signals generated during skin irritation and switch from a homeostatic to an inflammatory state.

This disease is three times more common in women, yet more severe in men, but the mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain largely unknown. MS is initiated by autoreactive T helper cells, but CNS-resident and CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells are the key proximal effector cells regulating disease pathology. We have previously shown that genetic ablation of p38α MAP kinase broadly in the myeloid lineage is protective in the autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), but only in females, and not males. To precisely define the mechanisms responsible, we used multiple genetic approaches and bone marrow chimeras to ablate p38α in microglial cells, peripheral myeloid cells, or both. Deletion of p38α in both cell types recapitulated the previous sex difference, with reduced EAE severity in females. Unexpectedly, deletion of p38α in the periphery was protective in both sexes. In contrast, deletion of p38α in microglia exacerbated EAE in males only, revealing opposing roles of p38α in microglia vs. periphery. Bulk transcriptional profiling revealed that p38α regulated the expression of distinct gene modules in male vs. female microglia. Single-cell transcriptional analysis of WT and p38α-deficient microglia isolated from the inflamed CNS revealed a diversity of complex microglial states, connected by distinct convergent transcriptional trajectories. Microglial p38α deficiency in males resulted in enhanced transition from homeostatic to disease-associated microglial states, with the downregulation of regulatory genes such as Atf3, Rgs1, Socs3, and Btg2, and increased expression of inflammatory genes such as Cd74, Trem2, and MHC class I and II genes. Taken together, these results reveal the presence of a p38α-dependent male-specific molecular pathway in microglia that is protective in CNS autoimmunity, suggesting that autoimmunity in males and females is driven by distinct cellular and molecular pathways, thus informing the design of novel future sex-specific therapeutic approaches.		microglia, female CKO;microglia, female WT;microglia, male WT;wildtype;pooled brain and spinal cord, D21 post EAE induction;p38 CKO;microglia, male CKO;female;C57BL/6;male

The mechanisms balancing adrenal hormone-producing cells and protecting against neuroblastoma or other tumors are still enigmatic. Here we revealed that adrenergic chromaffin cells release serotonin (5HT), which acts upon their immediate progenitor “bridge” cells via 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A (HTR3A). Consistently, the aggressive HTR3Ahigh human neuroblastoma cell lines reduce proliferation in response to HTR3A-specific agonists, suggesting the mechanism of anti-tumor protection. Physiological increase of 5HT in vivo caused prolongation of a cell cycle length in “bridge” progenitors leading to smaller chromaffin population and changing the balance of hormones and behavioral patterns in resulting adult rodents. These behavioral effects and smaller adrenals were mirrored in a progeny of pregnant females subjected to experimental stress, suggesting novel maternal-fetal link controlling developmental adaptations. Finally, these findings corresponded to a size-distribution of adrenals found in wild rodents with different coping strategies.

Therefore, suppression of microglia is a fundamental strategy to treat CNS disorders.

Methods: Ten ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mice were used for the establishment of dyslipidemic disease-syndrome models via multifactor-hybrid modeling, with 5 in the the PDR group and 5 in the SKYD group. Five C57BL/6J mice were employed as normal controls (NC) group, which is not included in the current records.. Test model quality. Aortic endothelial macrophages in mice were screened using flow cytometry. Transcriptomic analysis was performed for macrophages using RNA-Seq. Results: The quality assessment of the disease-syndrome model showed that TG, TC, and LDL-C levels significantly increased in the PDR and SKYD groups versus the NC group (P < 0.05). Combined with HE staining of aorta, the disease model was successfully established. The quality assessment of the syndrome models showed that mice in the PDR group presented with typical manifestations of the PDR syndrome, and mice in the SKYD group had the related manifestations of the SKYD syndrome, indicating that the syndrome models were successfully constructed. After comparing the differentially expressed gene (DEG) expressions in macrophages in dyslipidemia mice with different syndromes, 4142 genes were identified with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis for the DEGs showed that biological process of difference between PDR group and SKYD group include both adverse and protective processes were included. Conclusion: The DEGs between the PDR syndrome and the SKYD syndrome indicate different biological mechanisms between the onset of the two syndromes. They have distinctive biological processes, including adverse and protective processes, corresponding to the invasion of pathogenic factors into the body and the fight of healthy qi against pathogenic factors, respectively, in the TCM theory. Our results have demonstrated the biological evidence behind ‘treating the same disease with different treatments’ in TCM.

Six patients experienced a rapid fatal recurrence (RR) and other 6 had later non-fatal recurrences (LR). Before NAT, RR had low expression of 6 MHC class I and 13 MHC class II genes but were enriched in upregulated genes involved in the cell cycle-related pathways. Their TIL number before NAT in RR was very low (<5%) and did not increase after treatment. In post-NAT residual tumors, RR cases showed high expression of SOX2 and CXCR4. Our results indicate that high expression of cell cycle genes, combined with cold immunological phenotype, may predict strong TNBC resistance to NAT and rapid progression after it.

Chronic MS patients exhibit impaired remyelination capacity, partly due to the changes that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) undergo in response to the MS lesion environment. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is present in the MS affected CNS and has been implicated in disease pathophysiology. Of the two active forms of TNF, transmembrane (tmTNF) and soluble (solTNF), tmTNF signals via TNFR2 mediating protective and reparative effects, including remyelination, whereas solTNF signals predominantly via TNFR1 promoting neurotoxicity. To better understand the mechanisms underlying repair failure in MS, we investigated the cellular responses of OPCs to inflammatory exposure and the specific role of TNFR2 signaling in their modulation. Following treatment of cultured OPCs with IFNg, IL1b and TNF we observed by RNA sequencing marked inflammatory and immune activation of OPCs, accompanied by metabolic changes and dysregulation of their proliferation and differentiation programming. We also established the high likelihood of cell-cell interaction between OPCs and microglia in neuroinflammatory conditions, with OPCs able to produce chemokines that can recruit and activate microglia. Importantly, we showed that these functions are exacerbated when TNFR2 is ablated. Together, our data indicate that neuroinflammation leads OPCs to shift towards an immunomodulatory phenotype while diminishing their capacity to proliferate and differentiate, thus impairing their repair function. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TNFR2 plays a key role in this process, suggesting that boosting TNFR2 activation or its downstream signals could be an effective strategy to restore OPC reparative capacity in demyelinating disease.

Here, we present a novel report showing a tailored stem cell-based therapy which can aid in viral clearance and rescue liver and blood vessels cells from further damage during dengue infection by administering combination of hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells and dental pulp stem cells in a dengue virus-infected BALB/c mouse model. To analyze the molecular level changes induced by DENV infection and stem cell treatment in dengue-infected mice, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using MiSeq next-generation sequencing was employed in this study. Transcriptomics analysis was performed comparing gene expression patterns in different experimental groups. Methods: Liver mRNA profiles of 21-day-old healthy, Dengue virus infected, and dengue infected plus stem cells treated BALB/C mice were generated by sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Miseq V3 150. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were assembled and analyzed using Tuxedo software. The results were analyzed using Cuffdiff to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts. The relative expression of genes was determined based on FPKM (total fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads) values Results: After analysis, it was found that 59 genes were significantly up-regulated in the DVI group, and in the DVI-SCT group, 47 of the genes were successfully corrected to the level similar to that of control group, while the remaining genes showed down-regulation Conclusion: In the recent years, the incidence of dengue has continued to increase, but there is currently no rapid and effective treatment available. This study demonstrates stem cell therapy as a promising management to reduce the global burden of dengue.

One common cause of hearing loss is the presence of vestibular schwannoma (VS) a benign tumor of the VIII cranial nerve, arising from Schwann cells (SCs) transformation. In the last decade, an increasing incidence of VSs may be ascribed to the exposure to electromagnetic field (EMF), which may be considered a pathogenic cause of VS development and HL. In this paper, we explore the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the biologic changes of human SCs and/or their oncogenic transformation following EMF exposure. We investigated, by NGS technology RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis, the genomic profile and the differential display of HL-related genes following chronic EMF. We found that cell proliferation in parallel with intracellular signaling and metabolic pathways, mostly related to translation and mitochondrial activity were modified by chronic EMF exposure. Importantly, the expression of some HL-related genes, such as NEFL, TPRN, OTOGL, GJB2 and REST appeared regulated chronic EMF.		HEI-193;Repeated electromagnetic field;Swhannoma cells;None

AD-HIES is mainly caused by dominant-negative mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Clarifying the mechanisms by which STAT3 inactivation destructs bone metabolism is, therefore, important. Although, a few lines of data indicate osteoporosis induced by STAT3 inactivation may be related to increased osteoclast activity, here, we firstly report that deletion of Stat3 in osteoblasts, but not in osteoclasts, induced AD-HIES-like bone defects, including craniofacial malformation, osteoporosis, and spontaneous bone fracture in mice, and these defects were resulted from impaired osteogenesis induced by STAT3 inactivation in osteoblasts, but not increased osteoclast activity. Mechanistic analysis revealed a novel regulatory model in which STAT3 drove osteoblast differentiation via promoting distal-less homeobox 5 transcription in cooperation with MSX1. Furthermore, inducible deletion of Stat3 in osteoblasts also inhibited osteogenesis and induced bone loss in adult mice. Meaningfully, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 induced bone loss, while activation of STAT3 partially prevent bone loss due to tail sus-pension. Taken together, STAT3 is critical for both modulating skeletal development and maintaining bone homeostasis, and inactivation of STAT3 in osteoblasts, but not in osteoclasts, induced AD-HIES-related skeletal deformities by impairing osteogenesis, providing new insights for their treatment.

Resistance occurs when mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) render anti-androgen drugs ineffective or when constitutively active splice variants lacking the androgen binding domain entirely (e.g. ARV7) is expressed. In this study, we are reporting the discovery of novel AR-NTD covalent inhibitor 1‐chloro‐3‐[(5‐([(2S)‐3‐chloro‐2‐hydroxypropyl]amino)naphthalen‐1‐yl)amino]propan‐2‐ol (VPC-220010) targeting the AR-N-terminal Domain (AR-NTD). VPC-220010 inhibits AR-mediated transcription of full length and truncated variant ARV7, downregulates AR response genes, and selectively reduces the growth of both full-length AR- and truncated AR-dependent prostate cancer cell lines. We show that VPC-220010 disrupts interactions between AR and its known coactivators and interactors, such as CHD4, FOXA1, ZMIZ1, and several SWI/SNF complex proteins. Taken together, our data suggest that VPC-220010 is a promising small molecule AR-NTD inhibitor for the treatment of CRPC.		LNCaP cells

While both NAMPT and NMNAT1 were required for AML, we found that the presence of NAD+ precursors bypassed the dependence of AML on NAMPT, but not NMNAT1, pointing to NMNAT1 as a gatekeeper of NAD+ biosynthesis. We provide evidence that reduced nuclear NAD+ upon deletion of NMNAT1 activated p53, which is due to attenuated deacetylation by SIRT6/7 in AML cells.

We therefore dissected the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of fibroblasts undergoing MyoD-dependent reprogramming to either myotubes or iMPCs using a novel MyoD transgenic model. To this end, we performed single cell RNA sequencing for Pax7-nGFP positive iMPCs/satellite cells and cells undergoing dedifferentiation (i.e. Dox+FRG) or transdifferentiation (i.e. Dox) Our analyses elucidate the role of MyoD in myogenic reprogramming and derive general principles by which transcription factors and signaling pathways cooperate to rewire cell identity. Our results may also inform on potential therapeutic applications of direct reprogramming.

Unique transcriptomes define naïve, primed and paused embryonic pluripotent states. Here we perform calibrated transient transcription sequencing (TT-seq) to de novo define and quantify coding and non-coding transcription units (TUs) in different pluripotent states. We observe a global reduction of RNA synthesis, total RNA amount and turnover rates in ground state (2i) and paused pluripotency (mTORi). We demonstrate that elongation speed can be reliably estimated from TT-seq nascent RNA and RNA Polymerase II occupancy levels, and observe a transcriptome-wide attenuation of elongation speeds in these two inhibitor-induced states. Comparing closely related transcriptional states with different elongation speeds, we also discover a relationship between elongation speed and termination read-through distance. Our analysis suggests that steady-state transcriptomes in mouse ESC cells are controlled predominantly on the level of RNA synthesis and signaling pathways governing different pluripotent states directly control key parameters of transcription.		2 days culture in 2i medium;7 days culture in 2i medium;2 days culture in mTORi medium;TT-seq labeled RNA;Fragmented total RNA;1 day culture in mTORi medium;mESC;Rw4 (129X1/SvJ);mouse embryonic stem cells;culture in SL medium

The mechanisms underlying colitis pathogenicity and anti-TNF therapy resistance are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that RORα is highly expressed in active UC patients, particularly in those non-responsive to anti-TNF treatment. Rorα deficient CD4+ T cells could not induce severe gut inflammation in a T cell transfer colitis model. Mechanistically, RORα regulated T cell infiltration in colon by promoting T cell migration and inhibiting T cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, genome-wide occupancy and transcriptome analysis revealed that RORα promoted mTORC1 activation. mTORC1 signaling, also hyperactivated in active UC patients, was necessary for T cell-mediated colitis.

Several studies have shown that high CD276 expression in cancer cells correlates with a poor clinical prognosis. This has been associated with the presence of lower tumor infiltrating leukocytes. Among those, tumor-associated macrophages can comprise up to 50% of the tumor mass and are thought to support tumor growth through various mechanisms. However, a lack of information on CD276 function and interaction partner(s) impedes rigorous evaluation of CD276 as a therapeutic target in oncology. Therefore, we aimed to understand the relevance of CD276 in tumor-macrophage interaction by employing a 3D spheroid coculture system with human cells. Our data show a role for tumor-expressed CD276 on the macrophage recruitment into the tumor spheroid, and also in regulation of the extracellular matrix modulator PAI-1. Furthermore, our experiments focusing on macrophage-expressed CD276 suggest that the antibody-dependent CD276 engagement triggers predominantly inhibitory signaling networks in human macrophages.

This study aimed to investigate differentially expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with pSS to identify lncRNAs that affect pSS pathogenesis. Transcriptome sequencing detected 38096 lncRNAs and 50869 mRNAs in PBMCs from patients with pSS and healthy individuals. The differentially expressed mRNAs underwent functional enrichment analysis. A protein interaction relationship (PPI) and ceRNA network was constructed. LncRNA expression in patients with pSS and controls was determined using RT-PCR. 1180 lncRNAs and 640 mRNAs were differentially expressed in pSS patients (fold change > 2 in healthy persons). The PPI network was constructed with 640 mRNAs and a ceRNA network with four key lncRNAs (GABPB1-AS1, PSMA3-AS1, LINC00847 and SNHG1). A co-expression relationship was found between GABPB1-AS1 and several upregulated mRNAs (IFI44, IFI44L, IFI6, and EPSTI1). RT-PCR revealed that GABPB1-AS1 and PSMA3-AS1 were significantly upregulated 3.0- and 1.4-fold in the pSS group, respectively. In patients with pSS, the GABPB1-AS1 expression level was positively correlated with B cell and IgG levels. GABPB1-AS1 expression levels are positively correlated with B cell levels and may be involved in the pathogenesis of pSS.

This is the case for Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) in the retina, which transmit visual information to the brain via axons projecting into the optic nerve. RGCs are unable to regenerate their axon after injury, and start a degeneration process that leads to cell death and loss of vision. To identifying molecular mechanisms that increase regeneration of RGC and may offer new treatment strategies for patients with glaucoma or other types of optic neuropathies, we focused on the identification of transcription factors and chromatin accessible sites that are enriched in RGC during developmental stages, in which axon growth capacity is robust. We find that stage-specific gene expression changes are correlated with temporal changes in promoter chromatin accessibility. We also find that Creb binding motifs are enriched in the differentially opened regions of the chromatin at embryonic developmental stage. Overexpression of active Creb promotes axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Our results provide a map of the chromatin accessibility during RGC development and highlights that manipulating TF associated with developmental stages can stimulate axon growth in adulthood.		embryonic E21 day;retina;Retinal Ganglion Cell;postnatal day P11

In this work, we show a new role for ETV7, a transcriptional repressor member of the ETS family, in promoting breast cancer stem-like cells plasticity and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy in breast cancer (BC) cells. We observed that MCF7 and T47D BC-derived cells stably over-expressing ETV7 showed reduced sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug 5-Flouororuacil and to radiotherapy, accompanied by an adaptive proliferative behavior observed in different culture conditions. We further noticed that alteration of ETV7 expression could significantly affect the population of breast CSCs, measured by CD44+/CD24low cell population and mammosphere formation efficiency. By transcriptome profiling, we identified a signature of Interferon-responsive genes significantly repressed in cells over-expressing ETV7, which could be responsible for the increase in the breast CSCs population, as this could be partially reverted by the treatment with IFN-b. Lastly, we show that the expression of the IFN-responsive genes repressed by ETV7 could have prognostic value in breast cancer, as low expression of these genes was associated with a worse prognosis. Therefore, we propose a novel role for ETV7 in breast cancer stem cells’ plasticity and associated resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which involves the repression of a group of IFN-responsive genes, potentially reversible upon IFN-b treatment. We, therefore, suggest that an in-depth investigation of this mechanism could lead to novel breast CSCs targeted therapies and to the improvement of combinatorial regimens, possibly involving the therapeutic use of IFN-b, with the aim of avoiding resistance development and relapse in breast cancer.

Combining DNA and RNA sequencing, 756 patients were studied, and KRAS was observed as the most frequently mutated gene in patients at diagnosis; in addition, we demonstrated the persistence or de novo occurrence or the KRAS aberration at disease relapse. After several decades of effort, small molecule inhibitors targeting KRAS have emerged and are showing promising activity in clinical trials. However, these inhibitors are selective for tumors carrying that KRASG12C mutation and will only treat a subset of patients, predominantly with lung or colon tumors where this mutation is most prevalent. Therefore, there is still a need to develop novel therapeutic approachesto target the KRAS mutational events found in other tumor types, including MM. AZD4785, is a potent and selectivetherapeutic antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), tested in phase I clinical trials, which selectively targets and down-regulates all KRAS isoforms. Therefore, we explored the activity of AZD4785 in MM models, demonstrating its ability to strongly down-regulate KRAS andto inhibit the growth of MM cells, both in vitro and in vivo, confirming KRAS as a driver and a therapeutic target in MM.

The low specificity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer has resulted in the overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment of clinically indolent tumors. There is an urgent need for noninvasive and easy diagnostic assays to help evaluate whether a prostate biopsy is warranted. Many non-coding RNAs (eg, microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs) have been reported to play key roles in prostate cancer progression, showing great potential to impact cancer diagnostics and therapies. Remarkably, exosomes secreted by cells into body fluids contain molecules that reflect the disease information, and urinary exosomes could be used to detect prostate cancer as a new type of liquid biopsies. Non-coding RNAs are enriched and stable in exosomes.

A holistic understanding of how individual small molecules affect this balance is essential to anticipate immune-related side effects, select mitigating immunomodulatory therapies and highlight novel utility as immunomodulators. We previously showed that the high-specificity, low-toxicity cyclin dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) inhibitor DCA promotes tolerogenic effects in innate immune cells. Here, we demonstrate that DCA exerts a novel profile of tolerogenic activity on CD4+ T cells, promoting Treg and Th2 while inhibiting Th1 and Th17 differentiation. DCA enhances human Treg differentiation and our models demonstrate clear tolerogenic function of DCA-driven Tregs in the absence of confounding contribution from DCA-innate immune interactions. DCA engages unique mechanisms, including specifically enhancing early Foxp3 expression via regulating c-Jun phosphorylation, to promote Treg differentiation. CDK8 inhibitors are currently being developed to treat cancer; our findings suggest that the potential blunting of host-versus-tumor effects may warrant ancillary pro-inflammatory agents. Importantly, these results highlight novel utility of DCA as an immunomodulator, not only in vivo, but also in ex vivo cellular therapy.		2019-01-28;CD3/28;2019-02-01;none;M;2019-01-30;CD62L+ GFP- CD4+;GFP- CD4+;2 ng/mL TGFB;10 ng/mL TGFB;Sorted Cells;GFP+ CD4+;4 day;DCA + 2 ng/mL TGFB;naive;2 day

This region contains dozens of putative fetal brain-specific enhancers and is located ~0.7 Mb upstream of the neuronal transcription factor POU3F2. We identified a candidate causal variant, rs77910749, that falls within a highly conserved putative enhancer, LC1. This human-specific variant is a single-base deletion in a PAX6 binding site and is predicted to be functional. We hypothesized that rs77910749 alters LC1 activity and hence POU3F2 expression during neurodevelopment. Indeed, transgenic reporter mice demonstrated LC1 activity in the developing cerebral cortex and amygdala. Furthermore, ex vivo reporter assays in embryonic mouse brain and human iPSC-derived cerebral organoids revealed increased enhancer activity conferred by the variant. To probe the in vivo function of LC1, we deleted the orthologous mouse region, which resulted in amygdala-specific changes in Pou3f2 expression. Lastly, ‘humanized’ rs77910749 knock-in mice displayed behavioral defects in sensory gating, an amygdala-dependent endophenotype seen in patients with bipolar disorder. Our study suggests a molecular mechanism underlying the long-speculated link between higher cognition and neuropsychiatric disease.		embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5);Wild-type for rs77910749;C57BL/6J;female;wild-type;brain;Homozygous for rs77910749 knock-in;LC1 knockout;male;brain homogenate
GSE180913	2021.07.27	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	394	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Subcellular and regional localization of mRNA translation in midbrain dopamine neurons	Local translation within excitatory and inhibitory neurons is known to be involved in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Despite the extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations of monoaminergic neurons, the subcellular localization of protein synthesis has not been well-characterized in these populations. Here, we investigated mRNA localization in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, cells with enormous axonal and dendritic projections, both of which can release dopamine (DA). Using highly-sensitive sequencing and imaging approaches in mDA axons, we found no evidence for axonal mRNA localization or translation. In contrast, we found that mDA neuronal dendritic projections into the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we found dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicular release proteins in mDA neurons. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA transmission from dendrites, but not striatal axons. Finally, we defined a molecular signature of sparse mDA neurons in the SNr, including enrichment of an ER calcium pump previously undescribed in mDA neurons.

While the absence of Rnf31 induced sensitivity to T cell killing through TNF-mediated apoptosis in murine cancer cells and human PDA organoids, loss of Vps4b abrogated functional autophagy, resulting in accumulation of CD8+ T cell-derived granzyme B and subsequent tumor cell lysis.

GSE180822	2021.07.27	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	6	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Three-axis classification of mouse lung mesenchymal cells reveals two populations of myofibroblasts	The mesenchyme consists of heterogeneous cell populations that support neighboring structures and are integral to intercellular signaling. Despite such importance, mesenchymal cell types are poorly defined morphologically and molecularly, lagging behind their counterparts in the epithelial, endothelial, and immune lineages. Leveraging single-cell RNA-seq, three-dimensional imaging, and lineage tracing, we classify the mouse lung mesenchyme into three proximal-distal axes that are associated with the endothelium, epithelium, and interstitium, respectively. From proximal to distal, (1) the vascular axis includes vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes that transition as arterioles and venules ramify into capillaries; (2) the epithelial axis includes airway smooth muscle cells and two populations of myofibroblasts: ductal myofibroblasts, surrounding alveolar ducts and marked by CDH4, HHIP, and LGR6, which persist post-alveologenesis, and alveolar myofibroblasts, surrounding alveoli and marked by high expression of PDGFRA, which undergo developmental apoptosis; (3) the interstitial axis, residing between the epithelial and vascular trees and sharing a newly-identified marker MEOX2, includes fibroblasts in the bronchovascular bundle and the alveolar interstitium that are marked by IL33 and Wnt2, respectively. Single-cell imaging reveals distinct morphology of each mesenchymal cell population. This classification provides a conceptual and experimental framework applicable to other organs.

Here, we characterized single-cell transcriptional profiles of the mouse left ventricular cellular landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (10×Genomics). Detailed t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) analysis revealed the cell types of left ventricle with gene markers. Left ventricular cellulome contained cardiomyocytes highly expressed Trdn, endothelial cells highly expressed Pcdh17, fibroblast highly expressed Lama2 and macrophages highly expressed Hpgds, also proved by in situ hybridization. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analysis (ListHits>2, p<0.05) were employed with the DAVID database to investigate subtypes of each cell type with the underlying functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Endothelial cells included five subtypes, fibroblasts comprised of seven subtypes and macrophages contained eleven subtypes. The key representative DEGs (p<0.001) are Gja4 and Gja5 in cluster 3 of endothelial cells, Aqp2 and Thbs4 in cluster 2 of fibroblasts, as well as Clec4e and Trem-1 in in cluster 3 of marcophages perhaps involved in the occur of atherosclerosis, heart failure and acute myocardial infarction proved by literature review. We also revealed extensive networks of intercellular communication in left ventricle. We suggested possible therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease and autocrine and paracrine signaling underpins left ventricular homeostasis. This study provides new insights into the structure and function of the mammalian left ventricular cellulome and offers an important resource that will stimulate studies in cardiovascular research.		left ventricle;12 weeks old;heart;C57BL/6

CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing has been used to correct DMD mutations in animal models at young ages. However, the longevity and durability of CRISPR/Cas9 editing remained to be determined. To address these issues, we subjected DEx44 DMD mice to systemic delivery of AAV9 expressing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing components to reframe exon 45 of the dystrophin gene, allowing robust dystrophin expression and maintenance of muscle structure and function. We showed that genome correction by CRISPR/Cas9 confers lifelong expression of dystrophin in mice and that corrected skeletal muscle is highly durable and resistant to myofiber necrosis and fibrosis, even in response to chronic injury. In contrast, when muscle fibers were ablated by barium chloride injection, satellite cells were unable to restore dystrophin expression due to restriction of gene editing components. Analysis of on-target and off-target gene editing in aged mice confirmed the stability of gene correction and the lack of significant off-target editing at 18 months of age. These findings demonstrate the long-term durability of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing as a therapy for maintaining the integrity and function of DMD muscle, even under conditions of stress.

Therefore, exploring its potential pathogenesis and developing effective treatment approaches for AMI have become a research hotspot in the medical community. In the present study, clinical blood samples from patients with AMI were analyzed and the results showed that the expression of microRNA (miR)-124 was significantly increased in peripheral blood of patients with AMI compared with healthy subjects. In addition, miR-124 overexpression notably promoted the apoptosis of HUVECs and attenuated their proliferative ability. Based on these findings, RNA from HUVECs was extracted and sequenced to investigate the changes in the gene expression profile triggered by miR-124 overexpression. The upregulated genes were enriched in several signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, while the downregulated ones were mainly enriched in metabolic-related signaling pathways. Additionally, the chromosomal location analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were distributed in all chromosomes, except the Y sex chromosome. Furthermore, the characteristic profile of DEGs mediated by miR-124 overexpression was analyzed via Connectivity Map analysis. The analysis revealed that anisomycin and sanguinarine, two agonists of the p38/MAPK signaling pathway involved in the inhibition of angiogenesis, exerted the highest enrichment scores. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis demonstrated that DEGs were mainly enriched in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thus inhibiting angiogenesis. Collectively, the present results indicated that miR-124 overexpression could promote AMI by affecting angiogenesis.		huvec transfect with empty plasmid;huvec transfect with micro 124 expression plasmid;HUVEC

Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry to define the “lipidome” in prostate tumors with matched benign tissues (n=21), independent unmatched tissues (n=47), and primary prostate explants cultured with the clinical AR antagonist enzalutamide (n=43). Significant differences in lipid composition were detected and spatially visualized in tumors compared to matched benign samples. Notably, tumors featured higher proportions of monounsaturated lipids overall and elongated fatty acid chains in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine lipids. Significant associations between lipid profile and malignancy were validated in unmatched samples, and phospholipid composition was characteristically altered in patient tissues that responded to AR inhibition. Importantly, targeting tumor-related lipid features via inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 significantly reduced cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in tissue explants (n=13). This first characterization of the prostate cancer lipidome in clinical tissues reveals enhanced fatty acid synthesis, desaturation and elongation as tumor-defining features, with potential for therapeutic targeting.

Recent studies have suggested a sexually dimorphic role of microglia in the maintenance of neuropathic pain in rodents. Here, we utilized RNA sequencing analysis of microglia to identify whether there is a common neuropathic microglial signature and characterize the sex differences in microglia in pain-related regions in nerve injury and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy mouse models. Whilst mechanical allodynia and behavioral changes were observed in all models, transcriptomic analysis of microglia revealed no common transcriptional changes in spinal and supraspinal regions and in different neuropathic models. However, there was a substantial change in microglial gene expression within the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord 7-days after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Both sexes upregulated genes associated with inflammation, phagosome, and lysosome activation, though males revealed a prominent global transcriptional shift not observed in female mice. This study demonstrates a lack of a common neuropathic microglial signature and indicates distinct sex differences in spinal microglia, suggesting they contribute to the sex-specific pain processing following nerve injury.

However, it is unclear whether the decline in fertility of reproductively old males is related to the alterations of the sp and sEV which may have compromised effect on the immune microenvironment of the female uterus. In this research, we found a decrease in the implantation rate of pseudo-pregnant female mice which was treated with sp from reproductively old male mice (aged-sp group) than sp from young male mice (young-sp group). RNA-sequence analysis revealed an increase in the expression level of local cytokines and chemokines in the uterus of aged-sp groups than those of young-sp groups. Further in vitro experiments found an induction of dendritic cells (DC) maturation in the aged-sp groups. After isolating and characterizing sEV in young and aged male mice, we perfused the uterus of aged-sp group with sEV from young male mice and found it could partially rescue the low implantation rate of the aged-sp group. Further in vitro experiments found an induction of DC maturation after treating with sEV from aged male mice than that from young male mice, which indicated an age-related activation effect of sp and sEV. In conclusion, we found sp and sEV from aged male mice could induce the maturation of DC, which compromised the microenvironment of female reproductive tract, therefore leading to a decrease in implantation rate.		6-8 weeks after birth;uterus;ICR

It is thought that L. monocytogenes breaches the placental barrier by infecting trophoblasts at the maternal interface. However, the fate of L. monocytogenes within the chorionic villi and how infection reaches the fetus are unsettled. Hofbauer cells (HBCs) are fetal placental macrophages and the only leukocytes residing in healthy chorionic villi, forming a last immune barrier protecting fetal blood from infection. Little is known about HBCs’ antimicrobial responses to pathogens. Here, we present the first study of L. monocytogenes interactions with human HBCs isolated from healthy term placentas. Control untreated (5 h and 24 h) HBCs, 24 h LPS/IFNgamma-stimulated, and 5 h and 24 h L. monocytogenes-infected HBCs, were lysed with TRIzol. RNA was isolated followed by on-column DNase treatment and ribo-depletion. RNA-seq libraries were made, pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq SP flow cell in paired-end 150 bp format to a read yield between 70 – 80 million reads (equivalent to 35 – 40 million clusters). The RNA-seq data analysis showed that HBCs undergo pro-inflammatory reprogramming upon L. monocytogenes infection and following stimulation by the potent M1-polarizing agents LPS/IFNgamma. Of particular interest, infected HBCs also upregulated genes encoding numerous pro-inflammatory chemokines known to promote placental infiltration by maternal leukocytes. However, HBCs maintained expression of a collection of tolerogenic genes accompanied by secretion of tolerogenic cytokines, consistent with their tissue homeostatic role in prevention of fetal rejection.

B cell activation is initiated by antigens specific binding to the BCR, leading to an intricate signaling pathway responsible for B cell survival, proliferation, antigen processing/presentation and antibody production. We performed a genome-wide transcriptome profiling in splenic B cells from pregnant (P) and non-pregnant (NP) mice. We identified 1136 genes with differential expression in B cells from P mice (625 up- and 511 down-regulated) compared to NP animals. In silico analysis showed that B cell activation through BCR-signaling pathway as well as antigen processing/presentation and TLR cascades seems to be lowered during pregnancy. Further RT-qPCR analysis confirmed these data. In addition, B cells from pregnant women stimulated in vitro through BCR in combination with CpG, produced significantly lower levels of cytokines compared to non-pregnant women. Our results suggest that B cells acquire a state of hypo-responsiveness during gestation, probably as part of the maternal immune strategy for fetal tolerance. However, our results also open new avenues to understand why pregnant women are at highest risk for some infections.		splenic B cells from pregnant mouse;non-pregnant;splenic B cells from non-pregnant mouse;pregnant

Systemic infections often accompany these disorders, which can impede recovery and significantly worsen outcomes. Remodeling of the central nervous system (CNS) after injury is essential for functional recovery and depends on temporally and spatially coordinated innate immune responses; however, the effect of systemic infections on this process is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that a broad range of systemically introduced microbes and pathogen-associated molecular patterns interfered with immune-mediated meningeal vascular repair after TBI, with sequential infections promoting a prolonged state of disrepair. Mechanistically, we discovered that MDA5-dependent detection of a noncytopathic arenavirus encountered after TBI disrupted pro-angiogenic programming in recruited myeloid cells via local induction of type I interferon signaling. Systemic viral infection similarly promoted type I interferon-dependent impairment of restorative angiogenesis in the brain parenchyma after intracranial hemorrhage, leading to chronic blood brain barrier leakage, sustained interferon signaling, and a failure to restore cognitive-motor function. Our findings reveal an immunological mechanism by which systemic infections deviate reparative programming after CNS injury and offer a new therapeutic target to improve recovery and prevent states of prolonged neurological decline.		uninjured;No;Cerebral cortex;B6;Yes;Male;13 Weeks;injured_LCMV_infected;injured_no_LCMV_infection

In the current study, we proposed a systems biology approach to investigate the transcriptome profile of CD4+ T cells in patients at relapse phase. Materials and Methods: We performed RNA sequencing of CD4+ T cells isolated from four relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients at relapse phase and four age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The edgeR statistical method was employed to determine differential expression genes (DEGs). The gene set enrichment analysis was subsequently performed. Applying physical interaction network, genes with higher degrees were selected as hub genes. Results: A total of 1278 genes and 1034 gens were defined at significantly higher or lower levels, respectively, in CD4+ T cells of RRMS patients as compared with healthy controls. The top up- and down-regulated gene were JAML and KDM3A. The detected DEGs were remarkably on chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively. The DEGs were mainly enriched in pathways such as ‘regulation of transcription, DNA-templated’, ‘regulation of B cell receptor signaling pathway’, ‘protein phosphorylation’, ‘epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway’, and ‘positive regulation of neurogenesis’. Moreover, 16 KEGG pathways mostly associated with the immune system and viral infections were enriched. In the constructed physical interaction networks, UBA52 and TP53 were illustrated as the most highly ranked hub genes among up- and down-regulated genes, correspondingly. Conclusions: By applying global transcriptome profiling of CD4+ T cells, we deciphers the involvement of several novel genes and pathways in MS pathogenesis. The present results need to be affirmed by in vivo and in vitro studies.		Healthy control;RRMS patient at relapse phase;CD4+ T cells;Blood

Using mouse epidermal stem cells as a model, we elucidate how cells establish, maintain and recall inflammatory memory. Specifically, we landscape and functionally interrogate temporal, dynamic changes to chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and transcription factor binding that occur during inflammation, post-resolution and in memory recall following injury. We unearth an essential, unifying role for the general stress-responsive transcription factor FOS, which partners with JUN and cooperates with stimulus-specific STAT3 to establish memory; JUN then remains with other homeostatic factors on memory domains, facilitating rapid FOS re-recruitment and gene re-activation upon diverse secondary challenges. Extending our findings, we offer a comprehensive, potentially universal mechanism behind inflammatory memory and less discriminate recall, phenomena with profound implications for tissue fitness in health and disease.

Here we show that OPA1 is necessary for thymocyte maturation at the double negative (DN)3 stage when rearrangement of the T-cell receptor β (Tcrβ) locus occurs. By profiling mitochondrial function at different stages of thymocyte maturation, we find that DN3 cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Consistently, Opa1 deletion during early T cell development impairs respiration of DN3 cells and reduces their number. Opa1-deficient DN3 cells indeed display stronger TCR signaling and are more prone to cell death. The surviving Opa1-/- thymocytes that reach the periphery as mature T cells display an Effector Memory phenotype even in the absence of antigenic stimulation but are unable to generate metabolically fit long-term memory T cells. Thus, mitochondrial defects early during T cell development affect mature T cell function.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) mediate early immunity against infection and participate in tissue inflammation and homeostasis. It is unclear how ILCs acquire effector function, and whether these mechanisms differ between organs. Through multiplexed single-cell mRNA-sequencing we identified cKit+CD127hiTCF-1hi early differentiation stages of T-bet+ ILC1. These cells were present across different organs and had the potential to mature towards CD127intTCF-1int and CD127-TCF-1- ILC1. Paralleling a gradual loss of TCF-1, differentiating ILC1 forfeited their expansion potential while increasing expression of effector molecules, reminiscent of T cell differentiation in secondary lymphoid organs. The transcription factor Hobit was induced in TCF-1hi ILC1s and was required for their effector differentiation. These findings reveal sequential mechanisms of ILC1 lineage commitment and ILC1 effector differentiation that are conserved across tissues. Our analyses suggest that ILC1 emerge as TCF-1hi cells in the periphery and acquire a spectrum of organ-specific effector phenotypes through a uniform Hobit-dependent differentiation pathway driven by local cues.		mixed sample Hobit tdTomato/WT and KO;CITEseq/Multiplex ILC1 and NK cells from WT and KO;liver leukocytes

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), aberrant expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 a (HIF1a) and increased aerobic glycolysis metabolism represent drivers of the development of resistance to therapy with the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib. However, it has remained unknown how HIF1a is activated and how its activity and the subsequent induction of aerobic glycolysis promotes Sorafenib resistance in HCC. Here, we report the ubiquitin-specific peptidase USP29 as a new regulator of HIF1a and of aerobic glycolysis during the development of Sorafenib resistance in HCC. In particular, we have identified USP29 as a critical deubiquitylase (DUB) of HIF1a, which directly deubiquitinates and stabilizes HIF1a and, thus, promotes its transcriptional activity. Among the transcriptional targets of HIF1a is the gene encoding for hexokinase 2 (HK2), a key enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. The absence of USP29, and thus of HIF1a transcriptional activity, reduces the levels of aerobic glycolysis and reinstalls the sensitivity to Sorafenib treatment in Sorafenib-resistant HCC cells in vitro and in xenograft transplantation mouse models in vivo. Notably, the absence of USP29 and high HK2 expression levels correlate with the response of HCC patients to Sorafenib therapy. Together, the data demonstrate that, as a DUB of HIF1a, USP29 promotes Sorafenib resistance in HCC cells by upregulating glycolysis, thereby opening new avenues for therapeutically targeting Sorafenib-resistant HCC in patients.

The proL1 overexpressing variant (PC3 proL1+) and their parental cell line were plated in 6-well plates in triplicate (3 wells for each cell line). After 3 days, their RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit and their global gene expression patterns were analyzed using RNA-Seq Results: We identified 1698 differentially expressed genes between PC3 proL1+ and its parental cell line. Of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 209 were in common with LNCaP when proL1 was overexpressed. To identify biological functions that may be regulated through overexpression of proL1 in LNCaP cells, the list of DEGs was submitted to the DAVID, GOC, and KEGG databases, which identified 1250, 1366, and 480 unique genes within each database, respectively, which were then used for ontological analysis. According to these databases, proL1 overexpression regulated gene expression in ontological groups involved "anatomical structure development/morphogenesis" (more specifically "prostate gland morphogenesis"), extracellular matrix organization," "signaling," and "signal transduction. DEGs were also overrepresented in ontological groups potentially involved in vascularization and blood flow regulation. Analysis of the list of DEGs using the KEGG database identified the ontologic group "pathways in cancer" as having the greatest number of DEGs. DEGs were also identified with significant overrepresentation in specific biochemical pathways, such as the P13K-Akt, VEGF, and MAPK signaling pathways as well as steroid metabolic pathways. However, there were differences in the regulation of specific genes related to the androgen response between LNCaP and PC3. Unlike PC3, where overexpression of ProL1 caused a significant increase in expression of the androgen receptor gene (AR) and a decrease in expression of the estrogen receptor (ESR1), in LNCaP neither of these genes were changed in expression. In contrast, proL1 overexpression in LNCaP reduced expression of the progesterone receptor gene (PGR) but not in PC3 cells. Conclusion: Global analysis of the changes in gene expression caused by proL1 overexpression in PC3 and LNCaP cells supports that it has a role both in the modulation of genetic pathways involved in both overcoming hypoxia and the development of androgen-insensitivity. Opiorphins have previously been shown to be directly involved in regulation of blood-flow to tissues through their modulation of smooth muscle tone, and therefore their upregulation in tumors may directly contribute to overcoming the hypoxic barrier that develops in the growing tumor. In addition, overexpression of ProL1 in both PC3 and LNCaP cells modulated expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and morphogensis; the activation of these pathways would likely be involved in vascularization of the tumor and thereby also contribute to overcoming hypoxia. Overexpression of proL1 also affected genes involved in steroid metabolism and response pathways in both LNCaP and PC3, which could potentially contribute to the modulation of androgen sensitivity. In PC3 proL1+ cells we observed a significant upregulation of the Androgen Receptor (AR). Increased activity of the AR could subsequently lead to the activation of secondary messengers involved in modulating the activity of other signaling pathways such as the PI3K-Akt signaling and MAPK pathways, which had significant over-representation of DEGs in PC3 proL1+ cells. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is considered one of the most commonly dysregulated pathways in prostate cancer with approximately 40% of early stage, and 70-100% of advanced staged cancer exhibiting dysregulation of this pathway.

The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived liver transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) methods and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis Methods: Liver mRNA profiles of 8-week-old wild-type (WT) and liver specific conditional CTCF KO (CTCF cKO) mice were generated by deep sequencing, in quadruplet, using Illumina GAIIx. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 16,014 transcripts in the retinas of WT and Nrl−/− mice with BWA workflow and 34,115 transcripts with TopHat workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed stable expression of 25 known housekeeping genes, and 12 of these were validated with qRT–PCR. RNA-seq data had a linear relationship with qRT–PCR for more than four orders of magnitude and a goodness of fit (R2) of 0.8798. Approximately 10% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and Nrl−/− retina, with a fold change ≥1.5 and p value <0.05. Altered expression of 25 genes was confirmed with qRT–PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes uncovered several as yet uncharacterized genes that may contribute to retinal function. Data analysis with BWA and TopHat workflows revealed a significant overlap yet provided complementary insights in transcriptome profiling. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of retinal transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.

This study mechanistically defines the novel observation of pulmonary inflammation in the TLR9 mouse model of MAS that recapitulate key features of SJIA-LD, including IFNg activation. In acute MAS, lungs exhibit a mild but diffuse lymphocyte-predominant perivascular, interstitial inflammation with elevated IFNg, IFN-induced chemokines, and alveolar macrophage (AMf) expression of IFNg-induced genes. However, MAS resolution demonstrated AMf expansion and increased interstitial inflammation. AMf microarrays confirmed IFNg-induced proinflammatory polarization during acute MAS, which switches towards anti-inflammatory phenotype during MAS resolution. Interestingly, recurrent MAS increased alveolar inflammation, and reset polarization towards a pro-inflammatory state. Furthermore, in mice bearing macrophages insensitive to IFNg, both systemic feature of MAS and pulmonary inflammation were markedly attenuated. These findings demonstrate experimental MAS induces IFNg-driven pulmonary inflammation, and define this system for further study of and treatment validation in SJIA-LD.

In this study, we showed that LYAR expresses at a higher level in CRC than normal tissue and LYAR expression is closely associated with distant CRC metastasis. LYAR significantly promotes the migration and invasion of CRC cells in vitro, and reduction of LYAR expression in CRC cells inhibites xenograft tumor metastasis in vivo. Microarray analysis of LYAR knockdown (KD) cells combined with ChIP assay, gene reporter assay and rescue experiment indicate that FSCN1 (fascin actin-bundling protein 1, Fascin-1) serves as a new and key regulator of the LYAR-promoted migration and invasion of CRC cells. In addition, knockdown of FSCN1 significantly inhibites subcutaneous tumorigenesis of CRC cells. Moreover, we found that FSCN1 affects some key enzymes in lipid fatty acid metabolism such as FASN and SCD. In summary, this study reveals a novel mechanism by which LYAR promotes tumor cell migration and invasion by up-regulating FSCN1 expression and further promoting fatty acid synthesis in CRC.

The goal of this study is to identify alteration of gene expression in human osteochondromas in response to identify nontreated or RARg agonist-treated osteochondorma transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) and to evaluate the actions of RARg agonists on osteochondromas. Methods: Osteochondroma mRNA profiles of untreated or RARg agonist treated (4 days) osteochondroma explants were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 4000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results and Conclusions: Our study represents the detailed analysis of human osteochondromas, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome revealed that RARg agonists acts on human osteochondromas and altered various types of biological functions.

Since inflammasome-induced EVs could signal inflammasome pathway activation in patients with chronic inflammation and modulate bystander cell activation, we performed a systems analysis of the RNA content and function of two EV classes. Therefore, PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were either stimulated with inflammasome activators or TLR ligands and subsequently differently sized EVs (10K and SEC EVs) were isolated from the tissue culture supernatant. The RNA contained within EV preparations was extracted and subjected to the Clariom D microarray.

One of the key components of the RV144 vaccine was the use of the canarypox vector ALVAC as the priming component. Since AIDSVAX, the booster component, alone failed to provide protection we hypothesized that the ALVAC prime contributed significantly to the generation of protection. To test this, we designed a NHP immunogenicity trial to mechanistically link ALVAC vaccination with the magnitude of V1V2 titers, the most significant immune correlate of reduced HIV-1 acquisition in RV144. Our objective was to use a systems biology approach to identify the transcription factors, target genes and immune pathways which were being induced by ALVAC vaccination and associated with higher V1V2 titers. We identified the transcription factor CREB1 and its target genes as rapidly induced by ALVAC in multiple immune subsets and that CREB1 drives the expression and activation of a network of other TFs which are critical for modulating immune responses. Pathways induced by this ALVAC-CREB1 axis include lymphocyte/leukocyte migration, lymphocyte differentiation, antigen processing and presentation, T cell co-stimulation and cytokine signaling.

Thanks to their local application and transient effects, physical stimuli appear as attractive tools to remodel extracellular matrix, which was the point of interest in our to be published study. We assessed the potential of pulsed electric field technology, classically applied to drug delivery, to induce collagen remodeling at the tissue scale. A sophisticated in vitro tissue-engineered human dermal substitute, a tissue model rich in endogeneous extracellular matrix such as collagens, was used to demonstrate the effects of microsecond and millisecond pulsed electric fields applied respectively in electrochemotherapy (ECT) treatment and gene electrotransfer (GET) strategy. Our analyses, focused on matrisome genes and extracellular matrix remodeling, underpin that pulsed electric fields, a technology already approved for clinical use combined with anti-cancer agents, are particularly promising to provide local and effective treatment of abnormal extracellular matrix. Part of this dataset was used to describe how pulsed electric field on its own (with no addition of external drugs) induce extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling at human dermal scale, by focusing at genes related to matrisome subset. In this manuscript to be published, electrochemotherapy (ECT) parameters were named SP for "short pulses" and gene electrotransfer (GET) parameters were named LP for "long pulses". W demonstrated that these both types of electric parameters inducing reversible electroporation of the cells whitin the dermal tissue substitute induced 1) a rapid modulation (4h after electrostimulation) of mRNA’s genes composing the matrisome, particularly a down-regulation of pro-collagens and ECM maturation’s enzymes such as transglutaminase TG2 and LOX-like; 2) a transient decrease in pro-collagens production and hydroxyproline tissue content within a week after electrostimulation; 3) a long-lasting ROS-dependent over-activation of MMPs for at least 48h and 4) a down-regulation at both mRNA and protein level of pro-fibrotic TGF-β.		exposed to pulsed electric field of GET type (x10, 5ms, 600V/cm, 1Hz);Foreskin dermis;Dermal substitute no treatment;Male;Dermal substitute exposed to pulsed electric field of GET type (x10, 5ms, 600V/cm, 1Hz);Dermal substitute exposed to pulsed electric field of ECT type (x8, 100µs, 1000V/cm, 1Hz);exposed to pulsed electric field of ECT type (x8, 100µs, 1000V/cm, 1Hz);no treatment
GSE180621	2021.07.26	Homo sapiens	GPL17692	TRUE	TRUE	8	Expression profiling by array	FALSE			Transcriptomic profiling of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with sub-lethal concentrations of Wild Yam Root Extract (Dioscorea Villosa)	Background/Aim: Our previous in vitro high throughput (HTP) botanical anticancer cytotoxic screenings indicated that the wild yam extract (Dioscorea villosa (WYE)) has very potent anticancer effects in terms of espousing cell death with a low IC50 across diverse cancer cell lines including glioblastoma, melanoma, colon, neuroblastoma, and breast. However, unlike other botanicals we have focused on, WYE contains a high content of detergent steroidal saponins. As surfactants, they act by direct contact to rapidly reduce oil-water interfacial tensions causing disintegration of bio-lipid membranes. This study examined the WYE at sub-lethal concentrations where the saponin content does not create an interfering variable of lytic cell death in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Methods: A method validation study was first set up to cross-confirm the inverse relationship between saponin content with lytic cell death, where saponins were associated with loss of plasma and mitochondrial membrane potential and cytotoxic effects in both 2D and 3D cultures. Once appropriate sub-lethal concentrations were established, we then monitored changes in whole transcriptomic (WT) mRNA, miRNA, and long intergenic non-coding RNAs and cross- confirm this data by cell proliferation studies spot test antibody-protein arrays, and ELISA. Results: Upregulated DEGS reflected immune-stimulating effects centering on TNF signaling, COX2, cytokine release, and cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis. Downregulated DEGs show a very different transcriptome signature, revealing severe, extensive damage to cell cycle processes, including loss of transcripts for cell division cycle (CDC) genes (25A,45,6,7, A2, A7, A7L,8) cyclins (CCN.) (A2, B1, B2, E2, F) as well as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), centromere proteins (CENP), kinesin family members (KIFs), and polo-like kinases (PLKs) with exception to a corresponding upregulated DEG for p21 gene CDKN1A, all which were corroborated by the cytostatic effects confirmed during a 6-day proliferation study. Conclusions: In conclusion, WYE appears to mediate a saponin lytic effect at high concentration on direct contact, however at lower concentrations and independent of cell death, there exist three distinct biological consequences as found in this breast cancer cell model, including pro-inflammatory, steroid biosynthetic, and collapse of the cell cycle.

GSE180609	2021.07.26	Rattus norvegicus	GPL25947	TRUE	FALSE	11	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Mutations of the histone linker H1-4 in neurodevelopmental disorders and functional characterization of neurons expressing C-terminus frameshift mutant H1.4 	Rahman syndrome (RMNS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mild to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, vision problems, bone abnormalities, and dysmorphic facies. De novo heterozygous mutations in H1-4 encoding the linker histone H1.4 are found in individuals with RMNS; however, the underlying mechanisms causing significantly impaired neurodevelopment are not understood. So far, all neurodevelopmental associated mutations in H1-4 are small insertions or deletions that create a shared frameshift, resulting in a H1.4 protein that is both truncated and possessing an abnormal C-terminus frameshifted tail (H1.4 CFT). To expand understanding of mutations and phenotypes associated with mutant H1-4, we identified additional and new DNA variants at both the C- and N-terminus of H1.4. The clinical features of mutations identified at the C-terminus are consistent with other reports that strengthen the support of pathogenicity of H1.4 CFT.  However, the pathogenicity of disrupting variants at the N-terminus could not be determined. To understand how H1.4 CFT may disrupt brain function, we exogenously expressed wildtype or H1.4 CFT protein in primary rat hippocampal neurons and assessed neuronal structure and function. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed ~400 genes altered specifically in the presence of H1.4 CFT. Neuronal genes downregulated by H1.4 CFT were enriched for functional categories involved in synaptic communication and neuropeptide signaling. Neurons expressing H1.4 CFT showed reduced activity on extracellular electrode arrays, indicating that these transcriptional changes were sufficient to disrupt physiological neuronal function. These data are the first to characterize the consequence of H1.4 CFT in neurons. Our data provide initial insights into causes of  neurodevelopmental impairments associated with these frameshift mutations in the C-terminus of H1.4 and highlight the need for future studies on the function of normal histone H1.4 in neurons. 		GFP;H1.4 CFT;Primary hippocampal neurons;WT H1.4;GFP control;Exogenous wildtype H1.4;CD (Sprague Dawley) IGS Rats from Charles River Laboratories

Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or normal healthy controls (with or without infectious colitis) underwent ileocolonoscopy. In healthy controls, biopsies were taken in the sigmoid colon (n=21), ascending/descending colon (n=25) and the terminal ileum (n=12). In patients with Crohn's disease, biopsies were taken in the ascending/descending colon (n=107) and terminal ileum (n=70) in uninflamed areas in all patients; in patients with mucosal lesions, additional biopsies were taken in inflamed regions of the ascending/descending colon (n=35) and terminal ileum (n=55). In ulcerative colitis patients, paired uninflamed sigmoid (n=48) and inflamed sigmoid biopsies (n=46) were taken. Biopsies were placed in RNAlater at the clinical site, frozen and shipped to Genentech, where they were disrupted using TissueLyzer beads, then RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns.

Excess lipid causes cell dysfunction and induces cell death through pleiotropic mechanisms that link to oxidative stress. However, pathways that regulate the response to metabolic stress are not well understood. Herein, we show that disruption of the box H/ACA SNORA73 small nucleolar RNAs encoded within the small nucleolar RNA hosting gene 3 (Snhg3) causes resistance to lipid-induced cell death and general oxidative stress in cultured cells. This protection from metabolic stress is associated with broad reprogramming of oxidative metabolism that is dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling axis. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of SNORA73 in vivo protects against hepatic steatosis and lipid-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. Our findings demonstrate a role for SNORA73 in the regulation of metabolism and lipotoxicity.

Our aim is to delineate the CCR9+ Th cell-specific transcriptome to study the molecular dysregulation of these cells in pSS patients. Transcriptomic analysis of circulating CCR9+ Th cells reveals CCR9-specific pathways involved in effector T cell function, equally expressed in pSS patients and HC. Given the increased numbers of CCR9+ Th cells in the blood and inflamed glands of pSS patients and presence of inflammatory stimuli to activate these cells this suggests that CCR9-specific functions, such as cell recruitment upon CCL5 secretion, could significantly contribute to immunopathology in pSS.

We used human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cerebral organoids expressing tau-V337M and isogenic corrected controls to discover early alterations due to the mutation that precede neurodegeneration. Mutant organoids show early upregulation of MAPT expresssion and glutamatergic signaling pathways, as well as regulators including the RNA-binding protein ELAVL4. By 6 months, tau-V337M organoids show specific loss of glutamatergic neuronsof layers affected in patients. Mutant neurons are susceptible to glutamate toxicity, which was rescued pharmacologically by treatment with the PIKFYVE kinase inhibitor apilimod.

We used human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cerebral organoids expressing tau-V337M and isogenic corrected controls to discover early alterations due to the mutation that precede neurodegeneration. Mutant organoids show early upregulation of MAPT expresssion and glutamatergic signaling pathways, as well as regulators including the RNA-binding protein ELAVL4. By 6 months, tau-V337M organoids show specific loss of glutamatergic neuronsof layers affected in patients. Mutant neurons are susceptible to glutamate toxicity, which was rescued pharmacologically by treatment with the PIKFYVE kinase inhibitor apilimod.

The underlying mechanisms that contribute to disease pathogenesis remain largely unknown, partially accounted by the fact that mouse models with heterozygous deletions in Hnf1b do not develop diabetes, in contrast to the phenotypes observed in MODY patients. Here we used a well-controlled human induced pluripotent stem cell pancreatic differentiation model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying HNF1B-associated diabetes and pancreatic hypoplasia. Our results show that lack of HNF1B blocks specification of pancreatic fate from the foregut progenitor stage, but HNF1B haploinsufficiency allows differentiation of multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells and insulin secreting β-like cells. We further report that HNF1B happloinsuffiency impairs cell proliferation in foregut and multipotent pancreatic progenitors (MPCs). Our analyses suggest that this could be attributed to impaired induction of key pancreatic developmental genes, including FOXA1, SOX11, ROBO2, and additional TEAD1 target genes whose function could be associated with MPCs self-renewal. Taken together, these analyses have uncovered an exhaustive list of potential HNF1B gene targets during human pancreas organogenesis whose downregulation might underlie HNF1B-associated diabetes onset in humans, thus providing an important resource to understand the pathogenesis of this disease.

Loss or inactivation of both copies of RB1 results in initiation of retinoblastoma tumours, however additional genetic changes are needed for the continued growth and spread of the tumour. Ex vivo research has shown that in humans, retinoblastoma may initiate from Rb depleted cone precursors. Notwithstanding, it has not been possible to assess the full spectrum of clonal types within the tumour itself in vivo and the molecular changes occurring at the cells of origin, enabling their malignant conversion. To overcome these challenges, we have performed the first single cell (sc) RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses of primary tumour tissues, enabling us to dissect the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility heterogeneity of proliferating cone precursors in human Rb tumours. Methods: Two Rb tumours each characterised by two pathogenic RB1 mutations were dissociated to single cells and subjected to scRNA-Seq & scATAC-Seq using the 10x Genomics platform. In addition, nine embryonic and fetal retina samples were dissociated to single cells and subjected to scRNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses. The scRNA- and ATAC-Seq data were embedded using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Seurat graph based-clustering. Integrated scATAC-Seq analysis of Rb tumours and human embryonic/fetal retina samples was performed to identify Rb cone enriched subsets. Pseudotime analysis of proliferating cones in the Rb samples was performed with Monocle. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify the signalling pathway and upstream regulators in the Rb cone enriched subclusters. Results: Our single cell analyses revealed the predominant presence of cone precursors at different stages of the cell cycle in the Rb tumours and amongst those identified the G2/M subset as the cell type of origin. scATAC-Seq analysis identified two Rb enriched cone subsets, each characterised by activation of different upstream regulators and signalling pathways, leading proliferating cone precursors to escape cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of Rb tumor heterogeneity and defines molecular pathways that can be targeted to define new treatment strategies	Cell Cycle;Cell Transformation, Neoplastic;Transcriptional Activation;Cells, Cultured;Child, Preschool;Chromatin;Sequence Analysis, RNA;Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing;Humans;Infant;Male;Retinal Neoplasms;Stem Cells;Retina;Signal Transduction;Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases;Retinoblastoma Binding Proteins;Single-Cell Analysis;Retinoblastoma;Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells	20PCW;16PCW;Retinoblastoma_4months;Retinoblastoma_2years;Retina;12PCW;15PCW;Retinoblastoma;10PCW;21PCW

At present, little is known about the characteristics of Ppy-expressing cells. Using a Ppy-Cre driver, here we show that cells of the Ppy lineage contribute to four major types of endocrine cells, including beta cells. Unbiased single-cell analysis with a Ppy-lineage tracer demonstrated that beta cells are composed of seven clusters, which are categorized into two groups; i.e., Ppy-lineage and non-Ppy-lineage beta cells. These subpopulations of beta cells demonstrated distinct characteristics in terms of functionality and gene expression profiles. Ppy-lineage beta cells are less active in glucose-stimulated calcium signaling, are localized at the periphery of islets, and survive for long periods in experimental diabetes models, and sharing various molecular characteristics with PP cells. Our results indicate the unexpected degree of beta-cell heterogeneity defined by Ppy-gene activation, providing valuable insights into the homeostatic regulation of pancreatic islets, and future therapeutic strategies against diabetes.		pancreatic islets cells;mouse pancreatic islets cells;8 weeks;male;MIP-GFP; Ppy-Cre; Rosa26-tdTomato mice with a mixed background of C57BL/6J and CD-1

The pathways that maintain protein homeostasis support the transformation and growth of cancer cells. Here, we show that the cytosolic NAD+ synthesis pathway (controlled by NMNAT-2) plays an essential role in ovarian cancer by maintaining protein homeostasis by regulating the activity of PARP-16, that MARylates the ribosomal proteins. Using polysome-RNA Seq analysis, we found that inhibiting ribosomal protein MARylation by knocking down NMNAT-2 or PARP-16 leads to increased association of specific mRNAs with polysomes and enhanced translation of a set of mRNAs that contain specific secondary structures in their 3’UTRs, which leads to protein aggregation. Collectively, our study demonstrates that NMNAT-2 regulates PARP-16 activity and ribosomal protein MARylation, which control protein homeostasis by fine-tuning the levels of protein synthesis in ovarian cancers.

GSE180711	2021.07.25	Mus musculus	GPL24247	TRUE	FALSE	16	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			ZFP318 defines recallable B-cell memory	In response to antigen re-exposure, memory B cells can rapidly produce antibody-producing plasma cells (PCs) and, to various extents, secondary germinal centers (GC). ZFP318, a zinc finger protein that regulates spermatogenesis and IgD expression in naïve B cells, is not expressed in GC B cells but upregulated in GC-exiting memory B-cell precursors and maintained in the bulk population of antigen-specific memory B cells. Here we show that, unexpectedly, individual memory B cells of the same antigen specificity formed during the same primary response are not equally recallable. As revealed by a conditional fluorescence reporter, the recallability of post-GC memory is decided according to ZFP318 expression. Memory B cells that express ZFP318 are responsible for the recall generation of both plasma cells and GCs, whereas those that do not upregulate ZFP318 fail to contribute significantly to the recall response to antigen re-challenge. ZFP318 expression is promoted by T-cell help and its levels in memory B cells are positively correlated with B-cell receptor affinities for antigen. Ablation of ZFP318-expressing memory B cells essentially abrogates the secondary response. Complete ZFP318 gene deletion does not appreciably alter the outcome of a primary response in terms of GCs, total antigen-binding memory B cells, plasma cells or antigen-specific antibody titers but severely impairs subsequent memory recall in the host. Compared to memory B cells that do not express ZFP318 or ZFP318-deficient memory B cells, ZFP318-expressing memory B cells elaborate a transcriptome with enriched expression of mitochondrion-related genes, contain increased mitochondrial mass, and are fitter to respond to antigen stimulation. In prime-boost regimens of experimental vaccination against SARS-CoV2 antigen or with adjuvants of varying potencies, the numerical abundance of ZFP318-expressing memory B cells after the prime positively correlates with the quality of serum antibody responses long after the boost. Our results identify recallable memory B cells and reveal ZFP318 as a defining regulator of functional B-cell memory.

However, the discussion persists regarding their true role in patients. Here, we visualized central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory processes in models of MS live in vivo and in MS brains and discovered that CNS-infiltrating Th17 cells form prolonged stable contact with oligodendrocytes. Strikingly, compared to Th2 cells, direct contact with Th17 worsened experimental demyelination, caused damage to human oligodendrocyte processes and increased cell death. Importantly, we found that in comparison to Th2 cells, both human and murine Th17 cells express higher levels of the integrin CD29, which is linked to glutamate release pathways. Of note, contact of human Th17 cells with oligodendrocytes triggered release of glutamate. As we found that Th17-polarized cells release glutamate in contact with oligodendrocytic cells, we then assessed the impact of glutamate itself on human oligodendrocytes in primary culture. We found that 12-24h application of glutamate - but not pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα or IFN-γ - strongly decreased the area and complexity of human oligodendrocyte processes in vitro without affecting oligodendrocyte survival. To further investigate the impact of glutamate on human oligodendrocytes we used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of the human oligodendrocytes in primary culture, unstimulated (vehicle) and stimulated with glutamate. Following exposure to glutamate we observed induced cell stress and changes in biosynthesis of cholesterol and lipids in mature human oligodendrocytes. Finally, exposure to glutamate decreased myelination whereas blockade of CD29 preserved oligodendrocyte processes from Th17-mediated injury. Our data provide first evidence for direct and deleterious attack of Th17 cells on the myelin compartment and show the potential for new therapeutic opportunities in MS.		brain-resection path (normal tissue) from neurosurgery for epilepsy;Human oligodendrocytes in primary culture;vehicle (PBS) for 12h;sequenced as a second batch;Day 10 in vitro human oligodendrocytes in primary culture;glutamate 1mM for 12h;sequenced as a first batch

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy, and immune-based strategies to combat this disease have been largely unsuccessful to date. We corroborate prior reports that a substantial portion of PDAC harbors predicted high affinity MHC class I-restricted neoepitopes and extend these findings to advanced/metastatic disease. Using two novel preclinical models of neoantigen-expressing PDAC, we demonstrate that intratumoral neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells adopt multiple states of dysfunction, which are similar to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of human PDAC patients. Mechanistically, genetic and/or pharmacologic modulation of the CD155/TIGIT axis was sufficient to promote immune evasion in autochthonous neoantigen-expressing PDAC. Finally, we demonstrate that the CD155/TIGIT axis is critical to maintain immune evasion in PDAC and uncover a combination immunotherapy (TIGIT/PD-1 co-blockade plus CD40 agonism) that elicits profound anti-tumor responses in preclinical models, now poised for clinical evaluation.

Although immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized treatment for melanoma patients, majority of patients do not respond. The goal of this research is to evaluate whether epigenetic therapy targeting KDM5B could overcome resistance to immunotherapy. Methods:RNA-Seq analysis of KDM5B KO mouse melanoma cell lines compared to control cells to evaluate whether KDM5B depletion induces activation of retroelements, which subsequently activates type I interferon responses. Mouse studies were conducted to evaluate whether anti-tumor immunity induced by KDM5B loss could overcome immunotherapy resistance. Results: We identified that KDM5B depletion derepress retroelement expression, which subsequently activates type I interferon response and enhances anti-tumor immunity.

PolyA RNA was isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module, and bar-coded libraries were constructed using the NEBNext Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, Ipswich, MA). Libraries were pooled and single end-sequenced (1×75) on the Illumina NextSeq 500 using the High output V2 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Quality control was performed using Fastqc (v0.11.5, Andrews S. 2010)), reads were trimmed for adapters, low quality 5′ bases, and minimum length of 20 using CUTADAPT (v1.1). The number of reads per sample and the number of aligned reads suggested that read quality and number were good and that the data were valid for analysis. High-quality data were then mapped to human reference genome (hg19) using STAR mapping algorithm (version 2.5.2a). FeatureCounts implemented in Subread (v1.50) was used to count the sequencing reads from mapped BAM files. Analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subsequently performed using a negative binomial test method (edgeR) implemented using SARTools R Package.

Cellular senescence contributes to aging and ARDs. Removal and modulation of senescent cells (SCs) improve physical functions and extend healthspan in animal models. Thus, the development of therapeutics that target SCs (i.e., senotherapeutics) has been proposed as a promising strategy for the treatment and the prevention of aging itself and ARDs. We used drug repositioning to discover new senotherapeutics from 2,150 clinically applied compounds and found that homoharringtonine (HHT) has a senolytic activity in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) in vitro and in vivo models. HHT improved physical status and rescued aging phenotypes in progeroid mice and aged mice.

Using a sphingolipid network focused CRISPR/Cas9 library screen, we identified an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme, 3-Ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDSR), to be essential for leukemia cell maintenance. Loss of KDSR led to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and aberrant ER structure. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the indispensable role of KDSR in maintaining the unfolded protein response (UPR) in ER. High-density CRISPR tiling scan and sphingolipid mass spectrometry pinpointed the critical role of KDSR’s catalytic function in leukemia. Meanwhile, depletion of KDSR resulted in accumulated 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS) and dysregulated UPR checkpoint proteins PERK, ATF6, and ATF4. Finally, our study revealed the synergism between KDSR suppression and pharmacologically induced ER-stress, underscoring a therapeutic potential of combinatorial targeting sphingolipid metabolism and ER homeostasis in leukemia treatment.		sgKDSR#2;sgKDSR#1;CRISPR/Cas9;Leukemia;MOLM13;sgCtrl#1;sgCtrl#2;MV4-11

Strand-specific RNA sequencing libraries were generated using the Whole RNA-seq Lib Prep kit for Illumina (ABclonal, China). Final libraries were sequenced at the Novogene Bioinformatics Institute (Beijing, China) on an Illumina Hiseq X10 platform by a 150bp paired-end reads. The raw RNA-sequencing reads were filtered by FastQC, Reads were aligned using STAR v2.7.0f with default parameters to the Ensembl human genome assembly GRCh37. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 16,014 transcripts in the retinas of WT and Nrl−/− mice with BWA workflow and 34,115 transcripts with TopHat workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed stable expression of 25 known housekeeping genes, and 12 of these were validated with qRT–PCR. RNA-seq data had a linear relationship with qRT–PCR for more than four orders of magnitude and goodness of fit (R2) of 0.8798. Approximately 10% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and Nrl−/− retina, with a fold change ≥1.5 and p value <0.05. Altered expression of 25 genes was confirmed with qRT–PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes uncovered several as yet uncharacterized genes that may contribute to retinal function. Data analysis with BWA and TopHat workflows revealed a significant overlap yet provided complementary insights in transcriptome profiling. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of retinal transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.

Here we demonstrated that while lacking an L/IXCXE motif, HDAC5 interacts with both RB-N (via an FXXXV motif) and RB-C segments and this interaction is diminished by RB serine-249/threonine-252 and threonine-821 phosphorylation. HDAC5 gene is frequently downregulated or deleted in human cancers such as prostate cancer. Loss of HDAC5 increases histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27-ac) and circumvents RB-mediated repression of cell cycle-related oncogenic genes. Accordingly, HDAC5 loss confers resistance to the CDK4/6 inhibitors such as Palbociclib in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in mice, but this effect is overcome by the BET-CBP/p300 dual inhibitor NEO2734. Our findings reveal an unknown role of HDAC5 in RB-mediated histone deacetylation and gene repression and a mechanism modulating CDK4/6 inhibitor therapeutic sensitivity in cancer cells.

The transcriptome profile in SETD1A haploinsufficient neurons demonstrated perturbations in gene sets associated with schizophrenia, synaptic transmission, and glutamatergic synaptic function. In addition, transcriptomic data suggested cAMP/PKA pathway might be disturbed in SETD1A haploinsufficient networks, which was further verified by pharmacological experiments.

DNA-PK is a heterotrimeric complex that consists of Ku70 (XRCC6), Ku80 (XRCC5) and DNA-PKcs (PRKDC) subunits. DNA-PK complex is a major player in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair via non-homologous end joining pathway. This process requires all of DNA-PK subunits. Ku70/Ku80 heterodimers firstly bind to DNA-ends at DSB, that increase affinity of DNA-PKcs to DNA-ends. Recruitment of DNA-PKcs subunit to DSB leads to phosphorylation events near DSB, recruitment of another NHEJ-related genes that restore DNA integrity. However, today a lot of evidence demonstrate participation of DNA-PK components in other cellular process, e.g. cytosolic DNA sensing, apoptosis regulation, cellular movement and adhesion. It is important to note that not all subunits of DNA-PK complex are necessary for these process. This demonstrate the independent functions of DNA-PK subunits. Here we for the first time using NGS-sequencing analyzed the transcriptional changes in HEK293T cells under depletion of Ku70, Ku80 or DNA-PKcs to characterize the independent functions of each subunit.		treated with 50 nM siControl for 72 hours;treated with 50 nM siKu70 for 72 hours;293T_Ku70+/-;Human embryonic kidney 293T cells;human embryionic kidney cells;293T_Ku80+/-;treated with 50 nM siKu80 for 72 hours;293T_DNA-PKcs;293T;treated with 50 nM siDNA-PKcs for 72 hours

The liver endothelium encounters microbiota-derived signals and metabolites via the portal circulation. To pinpoint how gut commensals affect the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium, a magnetic cell sorting protocol, combined with fluorescence activated cell sorting, was used to analyze the transcriptome of hepatic sinusoidal ECs from germ-free (GF) and conventionally-raised (CONV-R) mice by RNA-sequencing. This resulted in a comprehensive map of microbiota-regulated hepatic EC-specific transcriptome profiles. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that several functional processes in the hepatic endothelium were influenced. The absence of a microbiota influenced the expression of genes involved in cholesterol flux and angiogenesis. Specifically, genes functioning in hepatic endothelial sphingosine matabolism and the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway showed a drastically increased expression in the GF state. Our analyses reveal a prominent role for the microbiota in shaping the transcriptional landscape of the hepatic endothelium.		Germ-free;hepatic sinusoidal ECs;CONV-R

According to the fluorescent MBD parameters, we divided the effects of 135 chemical on global DNA methylation into 3 categories; reduction (hypomethylation), increase (hypermethylation) and little/no effect. We performed RNA-seq analysis to examine the effects of chemicals on the expression of 100 stemness-related genes. In this series of experiment, we selected 5 compounds for genome-wide analyses. Etoposide, propyl gallate, and biotin were selected as representative chemicals of hypermethylation agents. Theophylline and bisphenol A were selected as representative chemicals of hypomethylation agents and undefined-epigenetic agents, respectively. Our results indicated that hypermethylation agents increased DNA methylation and downregulated the expression of genes involved in cell cycle or development.

Suppression of tumor antigen expression is a common adaptive mechanism that cancers use to evade detection and destruction by the immune system. Epigenetic modifications play a critical role in in various aspects of immune invasion, including the regulation of tumor antigen expression. To identify novel epigenetic regulators of tumor antigen expression, we established a transplantable syngeneic tumor model of immune escape with silenced antigen expression and used this system as a platform for a CRISPR-Cas9 suppressor screen targeting genes encoding epigenetic modifiers. We found that genetic disruption of the chromatin modifiers Atf7ip or its interacting partner Setdb1 in tumor cells restored tumor antigen expression, resulting in augmented tumor immunogenicity concomitant with elevated endogenous retroviral antigens (ERVs), mRNA intron retention. ERVs disinhibition was associated with a robust type I interferon response and increased T cell infiltration, leading to rejection of cells lacking intact Atf7ip or Setdb1. ATF7IP or SETDB1 expression inversely correlated with antigen processing and presentation pathways, interferon signaling, and T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity in human cancers. Our results provide a rationale for targeting Atf7ip or Setdb1 in cancer immunotherapy.		ab8898;sgSetdb1_2;sgSetdb1_3;sgSetdb1_1;C57BL/6;Kras G12D/ Trp53-/- LUAD cells;MC38 cells;wild type;SIINFEKL low;sgAtf7ip_1;sgAtf7ip_2;SIINFEKL high;sgAtf7ip_3

Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we have generated the first comprehensive transcriptional atlas of neonatal mouse meningeal leukocytes under normal conditions and after perinatal brain injury. We identified almost all known leukocyte subtypes and found differences between neonatal and adult border-associated macrophages, thus highlighting that neonatal border-associated macrophages are functionally immature with regards to immune responses compared to their adult counterparts. We also identified novel meningeal microglia-like populations that appear to participate in white matter development. Early after hypoxic-ischemic insult, neutrophil numbers increased and they exhibited increased granulopoiesis, suggesting that the meninges are an important site of immune cell expansion with implications for the initiation of inflammatory cascades after neonatal brain injury. Our study provides a single-cell-resolution view of the importance of meningeal leukocytes at different stages of development in health and disease.

While, neuronal oscillators within the mammalian central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), couple intercellularly via the exchange of secreted neurotransmitters, intercellular coupling among peripheral oscillators is highly debated and molecular mechanisms are unknown. In our study, we show that peripheral circadian oscillators couple intercellularly via the exchange of secreted signaling molecules and identify TGF-beta as peripheral coupling factor. TGF-beta signaling induces the cAMP response element dependent, immediate-early expression of the clock gene PER2, thereby phase-adjusting the molecular circadian oscillator. Genetic or pharmacologic disruption of TGF-beta signaling causes desynchronization of cellular oscillators resulting in amplitude reduction and increased sensitivity towards Zeitgeber cues. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of peripheral coupling and open a new perspective on the importance of peripheral clock synchrony for rhythmic organ functions and circadian health.		whole transcriptome (RNA-seq);bone osteosarcoma;16-18 hs post-sync;sparse;U-2 OS;control medium;wild type;U-2 OS conditioned medium;dense

We performed exome sequencing to identify the underlying molecular cause in five patients with CDAGS syndrome from four distinct families. Whole exome sequencing revealed rare variants that disrupt highly conserved nucleotides within the RNU12 gene. RNU12 encodes a small nuclear RNA that is a component of the minor spliceosome and is essential for minor intron splicing. Targeted sequencing confirmed allele segregation within the four families. All five patients in this cohort have a rare variant on one allele that either disrupts the secondary structure or the Sm binding site of the RNU12 snRNA. The variant on the other allele, shared among all five cases, alters a highly conserved nucleotide within the precursor U12 snRNA 3’ extension that is absent in 1440 unrelated healthy controls. All of the variants are either rare or absent from all searched public databases. Whole transcriptome sequencing analysis identified gene dysregulation and specific defects in intron retention in a subset of minor intron splicing. These findings provide evidence of the involvement of RNU12 in craniosynostosis, anal and genitourinary patterning and cutaneous disease.

Decreased levels of the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT), MOF, was recently associated with cerebral development and syndromic intellectual disability. However, the consequences of having a chronic reduction of MOF levels are still unveiled. Here we characterized by FIA-MS/MS the metabolic profile of Mof heterozygous animals. We generated the profile of 8 different organs that have distinct metabolic demands. Overall, our analysis revealed that Mof heterozygous mice have impaired glucose homeostasis, fatty acids metabolism, and amino acid accumulation. When exposed ad libitum to high-fat diet those animals failed to gain fat mass, while the lean mass remains unalterable. At the molecular level, using the adipocyte model we found that Mof regulates the expression of PPARs and Slc2a4. In summary, we identified the first KAT that shows high-fat diet resistance and we propose that the chronic reduction of Mof impacts metabolic disorders.​		wild type;WAT;Mof heterozygous;C57BL/6;standart diet;high fat diet

Integrin aE forms a heterodimer with b7; and aEb7 interacts with E-cadherin to mediate retention of aEb7+ cells in the intestinal epithelium. Baseline integrin aE levels have been identified as a potential predictive biomarker for etrolizumab response. Additional markers, including granzyme A, have also been identified and are being developed in partnership with Roche Molecular as potential predictive biomarkers for etrolizumab along with integrin aE. Extensive work has been done to characterize gut aE+ T cells by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and qPCR. We hope to use this project to validate differences between aE+ and aE- cell populations using CD4, CD8 and granzyme A expression as controls. The results from this project will be used to pilot single cell sequencing of CD3+aE+ cells isolated from the gut mucosa to identify cellular heterogeneity within aE+ cells under normal and inflammatory conditions. Materials and methods: Mucosal lymphocytes were isolated using a collagenase digestion from surgical specimens taken during routine gastrointestinal resections of diverticulitis and ulcerative colitis patients. CD45+TCRab+TCRgd- cells were sorted into aE+ and aE- groups.

The relative contribution of α4β7 and αEβ7 to gut lymphocyte trafficking remains to be characterized. Here we show that αEβ7 is highly expressed on human intestinal CD8+ cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and a small subset of proinflammatory CD4+ T cells. Dual blockade of α4β7 and αEβ7 reduced CD8+ T cell accumulation in the gut to a greater extent than single blockade of either pathway using a photo-convertible mouse model. αEβ7 blockade decreased T cell-epithelial interactions, increased the migratory speed and promoted egress of activated T cells. In Crohn’s disease patients treated with etrolizumab, a reduction of inflammatory genes and cytotoxic IEL gene signatures was observed. Concurrent blockade of α4β7 and αEβ7 increases reduction of cytotoxic IELs and inflammatory T cells in the gut mucosa through a stepwise inhibition of cell migration and tissue retention. The "SAMPLE_ID" sample characteristic is a sample identifier internal to Genentech.

GSE152306	2021.07.23	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	346	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE	GSE152321	34467254	Individual sorted T cell profiling from healthy donor	Etrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds the b7 subunit of the heterodimeric integrins a4b7 and aEb7, is currently in development for patients with moderate-to-severely active UC. Integrin aE forms a heterodimer with b7; and aEb7 interacts with E-cadherin to mediate retention of aEb7+ cells in the intestinal epithelium. Baseline integrin aE levels have been identified as a potential predictive biomarker for etrolizumab response.

However, a comprehensive global overview of the dynamic nature of these sequence features during erythropoiesis has never been obtained. Here, we use our ribonuclease-mediated structure and RBP-binding site mapping approach to reveal the global landscape of RNA secondary structure and RBP-RNA interaction sites and the dynamics of these features during this important developmental process. We identify dynamic patterns of RNA secondary structure and RBP binding that are consistently anti-correlated throughout mRNAs during erythropoiesis. Additionally, we determine a set of protein-bound sequence motifs and their dynamic structural and RBP binding contexts. Finally, using these dynamically bound sequences, we identify a number of RBPs that have known and putative key functions in post-transcriptional regulation during mammalian erythropoiesis. In total, this global analysis reveals new post-transcriptional regulators of mammalian blood cell development.		2 days;MEL cells;0 days;4 days

Human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells (MDA-MB-231, SUM159) were co-cultured with mice primary sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Breast can-cer cells were found to attach to neurons and have higher migration speed and prolifera-tion rate. Species-specific RNA sequencing highlighted cell migration and adhesion among the most upregulated pathways for cancer cells in coculture. We identified a novel mechanism where cancer’s PlexinB3 interacted with neuron’s Sema5A to regulate attachment and migration along nerve fibers. These findings demonstrate that sensory nerves induced a drastic shift in TNBC cells gene expression, and that dirupting the nerve-cancer is a viable strategy to impede metastasis		untreated;N/A;cultured in DRG conditioned media;Dorsal root ganglia;MDA-MB-231-GFP;7 weeks;SW-F;co-cultured with DRG

Here we identify a pattern of imbalance marked by basal epithelial cell growth and differentiation that replaces normal airspaces in a mouse model of progressive post-viral lung disease due to Sendai virus. Single-cell and lineage-tracing technologies identify a distinct subset of basal epithelial stem cells (basal_x0002_ESCs) that extend into gas-exchange tissue to form long-term bronchiolar-alveolar remodeling regions. Moreover, this cell subset is selectively expanded by crossing a cell growth and survival checkpoint linked to the nuclear-localized alarmin IL-33 that is independent of IL-33-receptor signaling and instead connected to autocrine chromatin accessibility. This mechanism creates an activated stem-progenitor cell lineage with potential for physiological or pathological function. Thus, conditional loss of Il33 gene function in basal epithelial cells disrupts homeostasis of the epithelial barrier at skin and gut sites but also markedly attenuates post-viral disease in the lung based on down-regulation of remodeling and inflammation. We thereby identify a basal-ESC strategy to deploy innate-immune machinery that appears to overshoot the primordial goal of self_x0002_defense. The findings reveal new targets to stratify and correct chronic and often deadly post-viral disease.

Here, we report a universal switch element that allows precise control for gene replacement or gene silencing after exposure to a small molecule. Importantly, these small molecule inducers are in human use, are orally bioavailable when given to animals or humans, and can reach both peripheral tissues and the brain. Moreover, the switch system (Xon) does not require the co-expression of any regulatory proteins. Using Xon, translation of desired elements for controlled gene replacement or editing machinery occurs after a single oral dose, and the robustness of expression can be controlled by drug dose and with repeated drug exposure. The ability of Xon to provide temporal control of protein expression can be adapted to cell biology applications and animal studies. Additionally, due to the oral bioavailability and safety of the drugs employed, the Xon switch provides an unprecedented opportunity to refine gene therapies for more appropriate human application.

Using super-resolution microscopy, we visualized that loops in intact nuclei are formed by a scaffold of cohesin complexes from which the DNA protrudes. RNA polymerase II decorates the top of the loops and is physically segregated from cohesin. Augmented looping upon increased loading of cohesin on chromosomes causes disruption of Lamin at the nuclear rim and chromatin blending, a homogenous distribution of chromatin within the nucleus. Altering supercoiling via either transcription or topoisomerase inhibition counteracts chromatin blending, increases chromatin condensation, disrupts loop formation and leads to altered cohesin distribution and mobility on chromatin. Overall, negative supercoiling generated by transcription is an important regulator of loop formation in vivo.		HeLa;DMSO

The exact underlying pathophysiology is unknown, and a suitable therapy is unavailable. We aim to identify molecular perturbations underlying this cardiomyopathy in a clinically relevant PLN-R14del mouse model. Methods: We investigated progression of cardiomyopathy in PLN-R14∆/∆ mice using echocardiography, electrocardiography and histological tissue analysis. RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry were performed on cardiac tissues at 3 weeks of age (before onset of disease), 5 weeks (mild cardiomyopathy), and 8 weeks (end-stage). Data were compared with cardiac expression levels of mice that underwent myocardial ischemia-reperfusion or myocardial infarction surgery, in an effort to identify alterations that are specific to PLN-R14del-related cardiomyopathy. Results: At 3 weeks of age, PLN-R14∆/∆ mice had normal cardiac function, but from the age of 4 weeks, we observed increased myocardial fibrosis and impaired global longitudinal strain. From 5 weeks onwards, ventricular dilatation, decreased contractility and diminished electrocardiogram voltages were observed. Strikingly, PLN protein aggregation was present prior to onset of functional deficits. Transcriptomics and proteomics revealed differential regulation of processes involved in remodeling, inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, in part similar to ischemic cardiomyopathy. Altered protein homeostasis pathways were identified exclusively in PLN-R14∆/∆ mice, even before disease onset, in concert with aggregate formation. Conclusions: We mapped the development of PLN-R14del-related cardiomyopathy, and identified alterations in proteostasis and PLN protein aggregation amongst the first manifestations of this disease, which could possibly be a novel target for therapy.		left ventricle;PLN R14del homozygous mutant left ventricle 3w;PLN R14del heterozygous mutant left ventricle 8w;Ischemia-reperfusion 3 days post injury left ventricle;PLN R14del homozygous mutant left ventricle 5w;none;IR_3d;WT left ventricle 5w;Sham 8 weeks post surgery left ventricle;WT left ventricle 3w;Pln R14del/R14del;C57BL6/J;wt;MI_8w;5w;3w;Sham 3 days post surgery  left ventricle;PLN R14del homozygous mutant left ventricle 8w;sham;Pln wt/R14del;12w;20w;WT left ventricle 8w;Myocardial infarction 8 weeks post injury left ventricle;8w

However, PARP inhibitor resistance is proven to be a major clinical problem. Acquired PARP inhibitor resistance has been linked with co-resistance to platinum-based drugs.

To explore dynamic regulation of vasoressin-mediated transcriptional regulation, transcriptome of vasopressin-treated cells at four different time points (3h, 6h, 12h, and 24h) were profiled and analyzed. Methods: Total RNAs were isolated from vasopressin-treated mpkCCD cells at different time points (3h, 6h, 12h, and 24h). Three replicates for vehicle- or vasopressin-treated group were generated at each tested time point. cDNA libraries were prepared using a Nextera DNA library preparation protocol. The sequence reads from Illumina HiSeq3000 platform were qualified and quantified at the transcript level using Salmon (0.14.1). Differential expression analysis were performed using edgeR. Results: mRNA profiles of mouse kidney collecting duct mpkCCD cells treated with vasopressin analog (dDAVP) for four different time potins (3h, 6h, 12h, and 24h) were generated using an optimized RNA-Seq workflow. Transcript level quantification using a pseudo-alignment quantification method (Salmon) was performed to calculate transcript abundance in each sample. Then differential expression analysis identified the differentially expressed genes including Aqp2 gene at each time point comparison (dDAVP vs vehicle, FDR < 0.05). In addition, several new vasopressin-responsive genes that have not been elucidated before were identified. Conclusions: This study revealed dynamic changes of vasopressin-responsive gene expression within 24 hours in mouse kidney collecting duct cells. The results from time-course transcriptome profiling identified the known vasopressin-responsive genes and several novel gene that are regulated temporally.

However, their function and expression in human cardiogenesis are not well studied. To delineate their expressions and assess their functions in human cardiomyocytes (CMs) in vitro, we established two triple reporter human induced pluripotent stem cell lines, HAND1mCherry, HAND2EGFP, with MYH6-driven iRFP670 or constitutive tagBFP expression and investigated their expression dynamics during cardiac differentiation. On day 5 of the differentiation, HAND1 expression marked cardiac progenitor cells. We profiled the CM subpopulations on day 20 with RNA-sequencing and found that mCherry+ CMs showed higher proliferative ability than mCherry- CMs and identified CD105 as a surface marker of highly proliferative CMs. Finally, we revealed that LEF1 is a key regulator of proliferation and is repressively regulated by HAND1 and HAND2.		siRNA transfected cardiomyotes derived from hiPSC;Ventricular protocol, siRNA transfected;Atrial protocol;cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSC;Ventricular protocol;isolated iRFP670+ mCherry-EGFP+;isolated mCherry-;isolated iRFP670+ mCherry+EGFP-;Cells differentiated into cardimyocyts on day 3 from hiPSC;isolated mCherry+;isolated iRFP670+ mCherry+EGFP+;isolated iRFP670+ mCherry-EGFP-;Cells differentiated into cardimyocyts on day 0 from hiPSC;Day 0;Cells differentiated into cardimyocyts on day 5 from hiPSC;Day 1;Day 3;isolated iRFP670+;Cells differentiated into cardimyocyts on day 9 from hiPSC;isolated iRFP670-;Cells differentiated into cardimyocyts on day 1 from hiPSC;Day 20;Day 9;bulk;Day 5;Cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSC

Here, we find that FOXC1 and paired box 6 (PAX6) are co-expressed in the human limbus and central corneal epithelium. Deficiency of FOXC1 and alternation in epithelial features occur in patients with corneal ulcers. FOXC1 governs the fate of the corneal epithelium by directly binding to lineage-specific open promoters or enhancers marked by H3K4me2. FOXC1 depletion not only activates the keratinization pathway and reprograms corneal epithelial cells into skin-like epithelial cells but also disrupts the collagen metabolic process and interferon signaling pathways. Loss of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and PAX6 induced by FOXC1 dysfunction is linked to the corneal ulcer. Collectively, our results reveal a FOXC1-mediated regulatory network responsible for corneal epithelial homeostasis and provide a potential therapeutic target for corneal ulcer.		3D-differentiated corneal epithelial cells;dCECs;limbal stem cells;none;FOXC1 (Bethyl Laboratories, A303-519A);shFOXC1;WT;primary limbal stem cells;H3K4me2 (Millipore, 07-030);scramble

The reconstruction of a gene network based on coexpression patterns is a fundamental task in scRNA-seq analyses, and the mutual exclusivity of gene expression can be critical to understand such heterogeneity. Here, we propose an approach for detecting communities from a gene network constructed on the basis of coexpression properties. The community-based comparison of multiple coexpression networks enables the identification of functionally related gene clusters that cannot be fully captured through differential gene expression-based analysis. We also developed a novel metric referred to as the exclusively expressed index (EEI) that identifies mutually exclusive gene pairs from sparse scRNA-seq data. EEI quantifies and ranks the exclusive expression levels of all gene pairs from binary expression patterns while maintaining robustness against a low sequencing depth. We applied our methods to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data and found that gene communities are partially conserved after serum stimulation despite a considerable number of differentially expressed genes. We also demonstrate that the identification of mutually exclusive gene sets with EEI can improve the sensitivity of capturing cellular heterogeneity. Our methods complement existing approaches and provide new biological insights from even a large sparse dataset in the single-cell analysis field.		patient derived glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) cultured in serum free condition.;GBM;differentiated glioblastoma stem-like cells indeuced by serum for 12 hour.;glioblastoma stem-like cells

While the functional impacts of TE-derived sequences on early embryogenesis are recognized, their role in malignancy has only started to emerge. Results: Here we show that many TEs, especially the pluripotency-related endogenous retrovirus H (HERVH), are abnormally activated in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples. The transcriptional upregulation of HERVH is associated with mutations of several tumor suppressors including ARID1A. Knockout of ARID1A in CRC cells leads to increased accessibility at HERVH loci and enhanced transcription, which is dependent on ARID1B. Suppression of HERVH in CRC cells and patient-derived organoids impairs tumor growth. Mechanistically, HERVH transcripts colocalize with nuclear BRD4 foci, modulate their dynamics, and co-regulate many target genes. Conclusions: Altogether, we uncover a critical role for ARID1A in restraining HERVH, which can promote tumorigenesis by stimulating BRD4-dependent transcription when ARID1A is mutated.

We developed a model of adaptive and maladaptive kidney regeneration by titrating ischemic injury dose. We performed detailed biochemical and histological analysis and profiled transcriptomic changes at bulk and single-cell level in >110,000 cells over time. Our analysis highlighted kidney proximal tubule (PT) cells as key susceptible cells to injury. Adaptive PT repair correlated with fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. We identified a specific maladaptive/profibrotic PT cluster after long ischemia. These cells expressed proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines and myeloid cell chemotactic factor. Druggability analysis highlighted pyroptosis and ferroptosis as vulnerable pathways in these profibrotic cells. Pharmacological targeting of pyroptosis/ferroptosis in animal model, pushed cells towards adaptive repair and successfully reduced fibrosis. In summary, our single-cell analysis defined key differences in adaptive and maladaptive repair and identified druggable pathways for pharmacological intervention to prevent kidney fibrosis.

The objective of this study was to compare transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) with microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for HIV-1-infected and uninfected MDMs and to evaluate the optimal protocol for high-throughput data analysis Methods: The mRNA profiles of HIV-1-infected and uninfected MDMs were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 20 million sequence reads per sample to the human genome and identified 60505 transcripts in the HIV-1-infected or uninfected MDMs. RNA-seq data confirmed stable expression of 15 known housekeeping genes, and 10 of these were validated with qRT–PCR. RNA-seq data had a linear relationship with qRT–PCR for more than four orders of magnitude and a goodness of fit (R2) of 0.8953. Approximately 10% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the HIV-1-infected or uninfected MDMs, with a fold change ≥1.5 and p value <0.05. Altered expression of 48 genes was confirmed with qRT–PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Conclusions: Our study represents the detailed analysis of HIV-1-infected macrophages transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.

Comprehensive experimental studies are thus needed to characterize the HIV-1-induced modulation of host genes in these myeloid lineage cells. To shed light on this important issue, we performed comparative analyses of mRNA expression levels of host genes in uninfected bystander and HIV-1-infected human macrophages using an infectious reporter virus construct coupled with a large-scale RNA sequencing approach. We observed a rapid differential expression of several host factors in the productively infected macrophage population including genes regulating DNA replication factors and chromatin remodeling. A siRNA-mediated screening study to functionally identify host determinants involved in HIV-1 biology has provided new information on the virus molecular regulation in macrophages.

We previously performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for BD risk accounting for the effect of body mass index (BMI) which identified a genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding the transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2). However, the molecular function of TCF7L2 in the central nervous system (CNS) and its possible role in BD and BMI interaction remained unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated by studying human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes, cells which highly express TCF7L2 in the CNS, that the BD-BMI GWAS risk SNP is associated with glucocorticoid-dependent repression of the expression of a previously uncharacterized TCF7L2 transcript variant. That transcript is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA-TCF7L2) that is highly expressed in the CNS but not in peripheral tissues such as the liver and pancreas which are involved in metabolism. In astrocytes, knock-down of the lncRNA-TCF7L2 resulted in decreased expression of the parent gene, TCF7L2, as well as alterations in the expression of a series of genes involved in insulin signaling and diabetes. We also studied the function of TCF7L2 in hiPSC-derived astrocytes by integrating RNA sequencing data after TCF7L2 knock-down with TCF7L2 chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Those studies showed that TCF7L2 directly regulated a series of BD-risk genes. In summary, these results support the existence of a CNS-based mechanism underlying BD-BMI genetic risk, a mechanism based on a glucocorticoid-dependent expression quantitative trait locus that regulates the expression of a novel TCF7L2 non-coding transcript.		replicate 2;replicate 1;non-target control  antisense oligo;non-target control siRNA;TCF7L2 siRNA;iPSC-derived Astrocytes;T208 lncRNA antisense oligo

Action of insulin through insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) maintain muscle mass via suppression of FoxOs, but whether FoxO activation coordinates atrophy in concert with mitochondrial dysfunction is unknown. In the absence of systemic glucose or lipid abnormalities, muscle-specific IR knockout (MIRKO) or combined IR/IGF1R knockout (MIGIRKO) impaired mitochondrial respiration, decreased ATP production, and increased ROS. These mitochondrial abnormalities were not present in muscle-specific IR/IGF1R and FoxO1/3/4 quintuple knockout mice (QKO). Although autophagy was increased when IR/IGF1R were deleted in muscle, mitophagy was not increased. Mechanistically, RNA-seq revealed that complex-I core subunits were decreased in MIGIRKO muscle, and these were reversed with FoxO knockout. Thus, insulin-deficient diabetes or loss of insulin/IGF-1 action in muscle decreases complex-I driven mitochondrial respiration and supercomplex assembly, in part by FoxO-mediated repression of Complex-I subunit expression.

PD-1 blockade “unleashes” CD8 T cells, including those specific for mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA), but factors in the tumor microenvironment can inhibit responses by dampening MANA-specific T cell function. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics are revealing global T cell dysfunction programs in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). However, the vast majority of TIL do not recognize tumor antigens and little is known about transcriptional programs of true MANA-specific TIL. Here, we use an integrated approach to identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells (MANAFEST) assay in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated lung cancers and use their TCR CDR3 as barcodes to track them and analyze their transcriptional programs and function in the tumor microenvironment using single cell RNA sequencing. We find both MANA-and virus-specific clones in TIL and adjacent normal lung, regardless of response status. MANA-specific, influenza (flu)-specific and EBV-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Most MANA-specific clones are tissue resident memory (TRM) cells, an incompletely activated cytolytic program, including EOMES deficiency, and higher levels of genes encoding T cell inhibitory molecules and Tox2. Notably, MANA-specific T cells express low levels of IL-7R and are functionally less responsive to IL-7 compared with tissue-resident flu-specific clones. MANA-specific clones from anti-PD-1 non-responding tumors express TCR with markedly lower ligand-dependent signaling capability, are largely confined to HOBIThi TRM subsets and coordinately up-regulate genes encoding specific checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors, and intracellular inhibitors of T cell activation and cytotoxicity. These findings provide mechanistic and potential therapeutic insights into overcoming resistance to PD-1 blockade.

We previously reported that activation of AMP kinase (AMPK) contributed to maintenance of naïve pluripotency. Here, we further show that AMPK activators, AICAR, A769662 or metformin, can induce the reversion of primed mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) to naïve pluripotent state. Primed mEpiSCs in our naïve cell culture condition with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and 2 kinase inhibitors (2i) (2iL) never gave rise to naïve state cells. Addition of AICAR alone even in the absence of 2iL or either of AMPK inhibitors with LIF induced appearance of naïve-like cells from primed mEpiSCs. Through maintenance and passages of these cells in 2iL condition, clear naïve-like morphology colonies were purely obtained. They showed core naïve protein expression, and global naïve gene expression profiles. These cells contributed to chimeric mice including germline transmission. Inhibition of p38 signaling abolished the AMPK-elicited reversion and forced activation of p38 in primed mEpiSCs partially reproduced the naïve cell induction, suggesting that p38 is one of the critical downstream in AMPK activation. Single cell RNA-seq analysis under AICAR stimulation successfully demonstrated the reversion process with appearance of intermediate naïve-like population. AMPK pathway should be a novel critical driving force in reversion of primed to naïve pluripotency.		129/Ola;epiblast

In this study, we combined the high-throughput alkaline CometChip® assay with the TGx-DDI transcriptomic biomarker (DDI = DNA damage-inducing) using high-throughput TempO-Seq® as an integrated genotoxicity testing approach. Objective: To determine if the high-throughput CometChip® assay and TGx-DDI biomarker analysis can be combined using human HepaRG™ cells to provide an efficient next-generation genotoxicity screening approach to identify DNA damage-inducing (DDI) chemicals. Methods: Metabolically competent human HepaRG™ cell cultures were exposed to increasing concentrations of 12 chemicals (9 DDI and 3 non-DDI) using a repeat exposure design (0 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr) in 96-well plates to measure and classify chemicals based on their ability to damage DNA. After a 4 hr recovery period, exposed cells were used to perform the Trevigen CometChip assay to assess DNA damage or used for TempO-Seq® S1500+ Targeted Transcriptome Sequencing for TGx-DDI classification purposes. Bioinformatics and statistical tools were used to classify chemicals as DDI or non-DDI using three separate analyses. Benchmark concentration analysis was also conducted for both assays for the purposes of potency ranking. Results: In combination, the CometChip® assay and the TGx-DDI were 100% accurate in identifying chemicals that induce DNA damage. Quantitative benchmark concentration (BMC) modeling was applied to evaluate chemical potencies for both assays. The BMCs for the CometChip® assay and the TGx-DDI for all 12 chemicals were highly concordant (within four-fold) and resulted in identical potency rankings. Conclusions: These results suggest that these two assays can be integrated for efficient, high-throughput identification of DNA damage in HepaRG™ cells. This study provides evidence for the complementarity of the high-throughput CometChip® assay with TGx-DDI biomarker analysis. Integration of these two tests provides an effective and high-throughput approach to identify DDI agents. This work is a first step in accomplishing a more integrated genotoxicity testing strategy to derive mechanistic information to better inform human health risk assessment in a high-throughput manner.

However, exactly how such dedifferentiation process affects beta-cell gene expression and islet microenvironment remains incompletely understood Method: We performed single-cell RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) in islets obtained from beta-cell-specific miR-7a2 overexpressing mice (Tg7), a murine model of beta-cell dedifferentiation and diabetes. Results: Single-cell RNA-seq revealed that beta-cell dedifferentiation is associated with the induction of genes associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) specifically in beta-cells of diabetic (12-week-old) Tg7 mice. These molecular changes are associated with a weakening of beta-cell:beta-cell contacts, increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and TGFb-dependent islet fibrosis. We find that the mesenchymal reprogramming of beta-cells is explained in part by the downregulation of Pdx1 and its inability to regulate a myriad of target genes preserving the epithelial cell phenotype. Notable among epithelial genes transactivated by Pdx1 is Ovol2, a transcriptional repressor of the EMT transcription factor ZEB2. Following compromised beta-cell identity, the reduction of Pdx1 mRNA levels decreases Ovol2 gene expression, which triggers mesenchymal reprogramming of beta-cells through the induction of Zeb2. Finally, we provided evidence that EMT signalling associated with the upregulation of Zeb2 expression is a molecular feature of islet of T2D subjects. Conclusions: Our study indicates that beta-cell dedifferentiation triggers a chronic response to tissue injury, which alters the pancreatic islet microenvironment and contribute to islet fibrosis. It suggests that regulators of EMT signalling may represent novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of beta-cell dysfunction and fibrosis in T2D.

However, the role and the molecular mechanism of Dax1 in the maintenance of different pluripotency states are poorly understood. Here, we constructed a stable Dax1 knockout (KO) cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to analyze the precise function of Dax1. We reported that 2i/LIF-ESCs had significantly lower Dax1 expression than LIF/serum-ESCs. Dax1KO ES cell lines could be established in 2i/LIF and their pluripotency was confirmed. In contrast, Dax1-null ESCs could not be continuously passaged in LIF/serum due to severe differentiation and apoptosis. In LIF/serum, the activities of the Core module and Myc module were significantly reduced, while the PRC2 module was activated after Dax1KO. The expression of most pro-apoptotic genes and lineage-commitment genes were drastically increased, while the down-regulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes and many pluripotency genes was observed. Our research on the pluripotent state-dependent role of Dax1 provides clues to understand the molecular regulation mechanism at different stages of early embryonic development.		passage 3;mESC;control;Dax1-knockout (KO);mESC_2i/LIF Control;mESC_2i/LIF Dax1 KO;mESC_LIF/FBS Control;mESC_LIF/FBS Dax1 KO
GSE167277	2021.07.21	Mus musculus	GPL19057	TRUE	FALSE	19	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Liver-dependent lung remodeling in the wake of systemic inflammation shapes responses to secondary infection	Systemic duress such as that elicited by sepsis, burns or trauma predispose patients to nosocomial pneumonia, demanding a better understanding of host pathways influencing this connection. These systemic challenges are also capable of triggering the hepatic acute phase response (APR), an event that we have previously demonstrated as essential for limiting susceptibility to secondary lung infections. In an effort to identify potential mechanisms underlying protection afforded by the lung-liver axis, our current studies aimed to comprehensively evaluate liver-dependent lung reprogramming following a systemic inflammatory challenge with endotoxemia followed by pneumonia. To do so, WT mice and APR-deficient littermates lacking hepatocyte STAT3 (hepSTAT3-/-), a transcription factor necessary for full APR initiation, were challenged intraperitoneally with LPS to induce endotoxemia. After 18h, pneumonia was induced by an intratracheal E. coli instillation. Lung transcriptional profiling, airspace proteomics, and additional validation measures were assessed after endotoxemia with or without a subsequent challenge with pneumonia in order to achieve an unbiased assessment of lung immune activity in the presence and absence of an intact liver response. In WT mice, endotoxemia elicited robust transcriptional changes in the lungs, with nearly 2,000 differentially expressed genes when comparing WT and hepSTAT3-/- mice. The resulting gene signatures revealed highly exaggerated immune activity in the lungs of hepSTAT3-/- mice, which were compromised in their capacity to launch additional cytokine responses to secondary infection. Proteomics also revealed substantial liver-dependent modifications in the airspaces of pneumonic mice, implicating a network of dispatched liver-derived mediators influencing lung homeostasis. These results indicate that following a systemic inflammatory event, liver acute phase changes dramatically remodel the lungs, resulting in a modified landscape for any stimuli encountered thereafter.

Combination treatment of HMGN1 immunostimulatory peptide (minP1) with anti-PD-L1 antibody exerted robust anti-tumor effects in the Colon26 subcutaneous murine model. To understand transcriptomic differences of the immune cell populations in the tumor-bearing mice after treatment with single-agent or combination therapy of minP1 with anti-PD-L1 antibody, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on CD45+ immune cell populations using the BD Rapsody system, NEBNext UltraII FS library prep kit, and a Illumina Novaseq 6000 S4 flowcell.		mixed sample (non-demultiplexed) representing Control, minP1, PDL1, minP1_PDL1;wild type;intestinal CD45+ cells;BALB/c;Colon26 tumor;subcutaneous tumor model

However, the full immunological profiling of acute TCMR remains unknown. Methods: A fully mismatched acute TCMR model was induced by transplanting the left kidneys from BALB/c mice into C56BL/6J mice. Allografted kidneys were harvested on day 7 (D7) and sorted for CD45+ leukocytes for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) . In addition, scRNA-seq data of CD45+ immune cells on day 15 (D15) containing GSE157292 dataset (samples GSM4761000 and GSM4761003) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. All data obtained from D7 and D15 were integrated and analyzed. Results: We identified 20 major immune cell types among 10921 immune cells, including macrophages, B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, neutrophils, and basophils in kidney allografts. Macrophages and CD8 T cells constituted the main immune cell populations on both D7 and D15. In the process towards immune regression, the proportion of CD8 T cells dropped significantly by about 25%, mainly due to decreased proliferation and naïve CD8 T cell infiltration. The proportion of both B cells and neutrophils also decreased by about 3 folds. On the contrary, the relative proportion of macrophages and DCs increased significantly, especially by a 4 fold increase in Ly6cloMrc1+ resident macrophages A group of Ly6cloEar2+ macrophages also increased by about 3 folds. Moreover, myeloid cells harbored the richest ligand and receptor (LR) pairs with other cell types, particularly for chemokine ligands such as Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Cxcl16 and Yars. However, macrophages with weak response to interferon gamma (IFNg) contributed to rejection regression. Conclusions: There is a comprehensive single-cell landscape of the kidney allograft immune cells from rejection progression to regression in acute TCMR. Reduction in CD8 T cells, B cells, and neutrophils while increasing in Ly6clo macrophages, including Ly6cloMrc1+ resident macrophages and Ly6cloEar2+ macrophages, may contribute significantly to immune rejection regression during acute TCMR.		allografted kidneys were harvested on day 7 (D7);8 weeks old;a pooled sample from two kidney allografts;allografted kidneys infiltrated leukocytes;allografted kidneys;BALB/c;C57BL/6

Existing pharmacological FOXM1 inhibitors attenuate resistance of cancer cells to treatment but exhibit insufficient specificity. We performed in silico screening of small molecules from NIH LINCS database to identify STL427944 compound that suppresses FOXM1 through a novel two-step mechanism. STL427944 treatment induces relocalization of nuclear FOXM1 protein to cytoplasm, where it is subsequently degraded in an autophagosome-dependent manner. Human cancer cells treated with STL427944 exhibit increased sensitivity to cytotoxic effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Transcriptome-based analysis of STL427944-induced gene expression changes revealed prominent suppression of gene signatures characteristic for FOXM1 and its downstream targets but no significant changes in other important regulatory pathways, thereby suggesting high selectivity of STL427944 towards FOXM1. We expect that STL427944 or its derivatives may be used in combination with different chemotherapeutical drugs to overcome tumor chemoresistance and improve anti-cancer treatment efficacy.

Then the macrophages were treated with HIV protein Tat or control for 12 hr. Total RNA was extracted for RNAseq Results: HIV protein Tat treatment induces 2640 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with false discovery rate (FDR) < 1 % and fold change > 3 in control macrophages. Those DEGs enriched in several biological processes that may contribute to atherogenesis. FAIME analysis demonstrated higher geneset scores of those GO terms in the Tat-treated macrophages from IKKβF/FLDLR-/- mice compared with the control ones. IKKβ deletion resulted in loss of geneset score in the macrophages of IKKβΔMyeLDLR-/- treated with HIV Tat. Conclusions: These results indicate that HIV protein Tat may affect many genes in macrophages related atherosclerosis development through IKKβ signaling.		12 hr;IKKbeta[delta]MyeLDLR-/-;Peritoneal macrophages (In vitro cultured);PBS (Control);Peritoneal macrophages;IKKbetaF/FLDLR-/-;HIV protein Tat;C57BL/6

We previously reported that activation of AMP kinase (AMPK) contributed to maintenance of naïve pluripotency. Here, we further show that AMPK activators, AICAR, A769662 or metformin, can induce the reversion of primed mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) to naïve pluripotent state. Primed mEpiSCs in our naïve cell culture condition with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and 2 kinase inhibitors (2i) (2iL) never gave rise to naïve state cells. Addition of AICAR alone even in the absence of 2iL or either of AMPK inhibitors with LIF induced appearance of naïve-like cells from primed mEpiSCs. Through maintenance and passages of these cells in 2iL condition, clear naïve-like morphology colonies were purely obtained. They showed core naïve protein expression, and global naïve gene expression profiles. These cells contributed to chimeric mice including germline transmission. Inhibition of p38 signaling abolished the AMPK-elicited reversion and forced activation of p38 in primed mEpiSCs partially reproduced the naïve cell induction, suggesting that p38 is one of the critical downstream in AMPK activation. AMPK pathway should be a novel critical driving force in reversion of primed to naïve pluripotency.		129/Ola;129/MSM;epiblast

Eosinophils have been demonstrated to be able to quickly infiltrate tumors and recruit other immune effector cells to enhance the effects of antitumor treatments, indicating that eosinophils might provide the key to more effective cancer immunotherapies. In this study, we established a stepwise differentiation approach for generating large numbers of functional EPX+ eosinophils from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) at near-100% purity. These hPSC-derived cells not only displayed eosinophil-specific phenotypes and expressed cytotoxic granular proteins, but more importantly, could also kill tumor cells in vitro, quickly infiltrate solid tumors in vivo and significantly suppress tumor growth in colorectal carcinoma and ovarian cancer xenograft mouse models. Our study therefore opens new avenues for the development of eosinophil-based immunotherapies to treat cancer.

The aim of this study was to determine the level of concordance between the spontaneous and implanted Qk/trp53/Pten (QPP) triple-knockout mouse GBM model and human glioma samples in regard to their immune infiltrates.We analyzed a cohort of fifteen spontaneous QPP mice, nine implanted QPP mice and 10 glioma patients histopathologically. Furthermore, we analyzed three spontaneous QPP mice, thee implanted QPP mice, and 10 glioma patients by single cell RNA sequencing. We found that the QPP model recapitulates human GBM regarding the major immune components including a predominantly myeloid cell population of monocytes, macrophages, and resting dendritic cells, with minor populations of T, B, and NK cells. In addition, the complexity of the myeloid cell populations is preserved between the QPP model and the human disease.

We previously showed that Vitamin C acts through TET enzymes to maintain the demethylated status of CNS2, a key intronic enhancer of the Foxp3 gene that is essential for the stability of Foxp3 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Here we show that Vitamin C enables genome-wide features of “induced” T regulatory cells (iTregs) in vitro that overlap with those induced by TET proteins during Treg differentiation in vivo. Vitamin C enhances IL-2 responsiveness in iTregs by increasing phospho-STAT5 levels, STAT5 occupancy and DNA demethylation at key Treg-specific enhancers, and maintains the stable expression of Treg-specific genes including Foxp3 and Il2ra. Our data will be relevant to future studies of the association between plasma Vitamin C levels, Treg function and autoimmunity in humans.		iTregs differentiated in the presence of TGFβ+RA;iTregs differentiated in the presence of TGFβ+RA+VitC;iTregs differentiated in the presence of TGFβ;Th0 cells differentiated with anti-CD3/CD28;TGF.1.day6;RE.1.NEG;C57BL/6;iTregs differentiated in the presence of TGFβ+VitC;CD4+eGFP+ Treg cells;TGF.3.day6;TGF-1;naive-2;TGF-2;5-6 weeks;iTregs differentiated in the presence of TGFβ and sorted for Foxp3+ cells on day6;naive-1;dko-4;dko-3;dko-2;dko-1;TH0-2;Tet2fl/fl Tet3fl/fl Foxp3-eGFP;TH0-1;Spleen and lymph nodes;RA-VC-1;3 weeks;RE.3.NEG;CD4+eGFP-CD25-CD62LhiCD44lo naïve T cells;TGFβ iTregs after anti-CD3/CD28 restimulation, Foxp3- cells were sorted on day6 after restimulation;RA-2;wt-4;wt-3;Tet2fl/fl Tet3fl/fl Foxp3-eGFP CD4-Cre;12-14 weeks;RA-1;wt-2;wt-1;VC-1;Foxp3-eGFP reporter mice;VC-2;RE.2.NEG;RA-VC-2;TGF.2.day6

Studying the impact of the inhibition of cholesterol de novo synthesis in the epidermis may help understand how skin homeostasis is regulated. Objective: In this study, we created a gene expression profile to investigate the effect of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on epidermal homeostasis. Methods: A microarray analysis was performed using normal keratinocytes with or without HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (pitavastatin) treatment. Real-time PCR confirmed the reproducibility of genes with altered expression in keratinocytes treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Among these genes, we focused on reduced expression of claudin 7 histologically confirmed by immunohistochemical staining, in situ hybridization, and immunoelectron microscopy. Results: Claudin-7 was highly expressed in the stratum granulosum of psoriatic lesions but was not expressed in the normal epidermis. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that claudin-7 was localized in the keratohyalin granules of psoriatic lesions. Conclusion: These results indicate that claudin-7 expression was regulated by HMG-CoA reductase in the epidermis and might play a pathogenic role in the keratohyalin granules found in the epidermal granular layer of psoriasis.

By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.

Among the plethora of mechanisms which might be involved, it is now clear that that immune molecules released upon inflammatory state can modulate different physiological aspects of brain development, resulting in long-lasting pathological consequences which may interfere with normal behavior during adulthood. A common aspect of this immune molecule is to promote deep transcriptional changes responsible for long-term effects. Single-cell RNA sequencing is now becoming a cutting-edge technology for studying the genomic rearrangement occurring at single cell level in different experimental models, thus opening a new frontier in medicine. Here, by using primary cultured neurons as a simplified model for studying neuronal development, we study the long-term consequences of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukine-6 (IL-6) on developing neurons through a single-cell sequencing approach. Based on the immuneprofiling of the analyzed cells, we identified different neuronal and non-neuronal cell clusters whose transcriptional profile changed specifically upon the inflammatory stimulation.

Loss of miR-101 increases the expression of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) subunit enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), resulting in alterations to the epigenome and enhanced tumorigenesis. MiR-101 has also been shown to modulate various aspects of cellular metabolism, however little is known about the mechanisms involved. To investigate the metabolic pathways that are regulated by miR-101, we performed transcriptome and functional analyses of osteosarcoma cells overexpressing miR-101. We found that miR-101 downregulates multiple mitochondrial processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, the citric acid cycle and phospholipid metabolism. We also found that miR-101 overexpression disrupts the transcription of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) via the downregulation of the mitochondrial transcription initiation complex proteins TFB2M and Mic60. These alterations in protein expression disrupt mitochondrial function, with significant decreases in both basal (54%) and maximal (67%) mitochondrial respiration rates. Native gel electrophoresis revealed that this diminished respiratory capacity was associated with reduced steady-state levels of mature succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), with a corresponding reduction of complex II enzymatic activity. Furthermore, miR-101 overexpression reduced the expression of the SDHB subunit, with a concomitant disruption of the assembly of the SDHC subunit into mature complex II. Overall, we describe a new role for miR-101 as a modulator of mitochondrial metabolism via its regulation of multiple mitochondrial processes, including mtDNA transcription and complex II biogenesis.

GSE180261	2021.07.20	Mus musculus	GPL13112	TRUE	FALSE	10	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE			Dysregulated myogenesis and autophagy in genetically induced pulmonary emphysema	Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-pulmonary emphysema often develop locomotor muscle dysfunction, which is independently associated with disability and higher mortality in that population. Muscle dysfunction entails reduced muscle mass and force-generation capacity, which are influenced by fibers integrity. Myogenesis, which is muscle turnover driven by progenitor cells such as satellite cells, contributes to the maintenance of muscle integrity in the context of organ development and injury-repair cycles. Injurious events crucially occur in COPD patients’ skeletal muscles in the setting of exacerbations and infections which lead to acute decompensations for limited periods of time after which, patients typically fail to recover the baseline status they had before the acute event. Autophagy, which is dysregulated in muscles from COPD patients, is a key regulator of satellite cells activation and myogenesis, yet very little research has so far investigated the mechanistic role of autophagy dysregulation in COPD muscles. Using a genetically inducible murine model of COPD-driven muscle dysfunction and confirmed with a second genetic animal model, we found a significant myogenic dysfunction associated with a reduced proliferative capacity of freshly isolated satellite cells. Transplantation experiments followed by lineage tracing suggest that an intrinsic defect in satellite cells, and not in the COPD environment, plays a dominant role in the observed myogenic dysfunction. RNA sequencing analysis of freshly isolated satellite cells suggests cell cycle and autophagy dysregulation, which is confirmed by a direct observation of COPD mice satellite cells fluorescent-tracked autophagosome formation. Moreover, spermidine-induced autophagy stimulation leads to improved satellite cells autophagosome turnover, replication rate and myogenesis. Our data suggests that pulmonary emphysema causes a disrupted myogenesis, which could be improved with stimulation of autophagy and satellite cells activation, leading to an attenuated muscle dysfunction in this context.

We previously reported that MIF regulates MM bone marrow homing and knockdown of MIF favors the extramedullary myeloma formation in mice. Here, based on MIF immunostaining of myeloma cells in paired intramedullary and extramedullary biopsies from 17 patients, we found lower MIF intensity in extramedullary MM (EMM) versus intramedullary MM (IMM). Flow cytometry and histology analysis in ARD cell line-derived xenograft models showed a portion of inoculated human MM cells lost their MIF expression (MIFLow) in vivo. Of note, IMM had dominantly MIFHigh cells, while EMM showed a significantly increased ratio of MIFLow cells. We harvested the extramedullary human MM cells from a mouse and generated single-cell transcriptomic data. The developmental trajectories of MM cells from the MIFHigh to MIFLow state were indicated. The MIFHigh cells featured higher proliferation. The MIFLow ones were more quiescent and harbored abundant ribosomal protein genes. Our findings identified in vivo differential regulation of MIF expression in MM and suggested a potential pathogenic role of MIF in the extramedullary spread of disease.		untreated;spleen;xenografted ARD cells in spleen;human MM cell line ARD;immunocompromised B-NDG mouse (NOD-Prkdcscid IL2rgtm1/Bcgen);wild type;extramedullary multiple myeloma;CD138+ MM cells;six weeks

A specifically designed strategy was applied to oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) in order to detect ectopic gene activations and develop a prognostic stratification test. A dedicated original prognosis biomarker discovery approach was implemented using genome-wide transcriptomic data of OSCC, including training and validation cohorts. Abnormal expressions of silent genes were systematically detected, correlated with survival probabilities and evaluated as predictive biomarkers. The resulting stratification test was confirmed in a third cohort using immunohistochemistry. In order to address the potential interest of the ectopic expressions as therapeutic targets, the transcriptome of OSCC cells in which one of the predictive marker genes, CCNA1, was inactivated was analysed by RNAseq. The genome-wide expression profile of an OSCC cell line, where CCNA1 had been inactivated was found similar to that of aggressive tumours positive for the three genes. The exploration of the whole gene expression profile characterizing aggressive OSCC tumours highlights their enhanced proliferative and poorly differentiated intrinsic nature. Our experimental targeting of CCNA1 in OSCC cells is associated with a shift of transcriptomic signature towards the less aggressive form of OSCC, suggesting it could be a good target for therapeutic approaches.		si_control;si_ccna1;FaDu;FaDu cells (OSCC cell line ATCC)

Many of these families contain chromosomal rearrangements at 2q31, where the human HOXD locus maps. In mice, the dominant X-ray-induced Ulnaless inversion of the HoxD gene cluster produces a similar phenotype suggesting that the same pathological mechanism is at work in humans and mice. A tentative hypothesis was proposed where the various alterations to the genomic structure of HOXD could translocate Hoxd13 near to proximal limb enhancers, leading to its deleterious gain-of-expression in the embryonic forelimb. We evaluated this hypothesis by engineering a ca. 1Mb large inversion including the HoxD gene cluster, in order to position Hoxd13 within a chromatin domain rich in proximal limb enhancers. We show that these enhancers contact and activate Hoxd13 in proximal cells, concomitant to the formation of a mesomelic dysplasia phenotype. A secondary mutation in the coding frame of the HOXD13 protein in-cis with the inversion completely rescued the limb alterations, demonstrating that ectopic HOXD13 is indeed the unique cause of this bone anomaly. Single cell expression analysis and evaluation of HOXD13 binding sites in cells from this ectopic expression domain suggests that the phenotype arises primarily by acting through genes normally controlled by HOXD13 in distal limb cells. Altogether, these results provide a conceptual and mechanistic framework to understand and unify the molecular origins of human mesomelic dysplasia associated with 2q31.

Circulating CECs increase in healthy newborns or patients with hemolytic, malignant and cardiopulmonary disorders. To assess the pathophysiological role of CECs in inflammatory diseases, we studied the gene expression and function focusing on systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with SoJIA expressed upregulated erythropoiesis-related genes, that determined the largest increase of circulating CECs during active phase SoJIA of all inflammatory diseases including polyarthritis, Kawasaki disease, bacteremia and systemic lupus erythematosus. Despite the opposite roles of erythropoietin and hepcidin in erythropoiesis, both serum levels positively correlated with the amounts of peripheral blood CECs in SoJIA patients. There were positive correlations between CECs and inflammatory markers of C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, or soluble TNF receptor. Co-culture with active SoJIA-driven CECs significantly suppressed the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 from healthy donor monocytes. The top of upregulated genes in SoJIA-driven CECs was ARG2 compared with those in CECs from cord blood controls. On the other hand, cytokine productions from monocytes were suppressed by co-culture even with an arginase inhibitor. CECs are mobilized to periphery in SoJIA for the control of excessive inflammation via the immuno-regulatory pathways partly involving arginase-2. Understanding the association between CECs and magnitude of systemic inflammation may clarify the unappreciated role of erythroid precursors in health and disease process of immune dysregulation.

Translation-independent ER association (TiERA) has been reported for certain mRNAs, but the phenomenon is poorly understood. Here, using cell fractionation, polysome profiling, and 3’ end sequencing, we examine TiERA of poly(A)+ RNAs in mouse C2C12 myoblast cells. We identify transcript features that facilitate TiERA, including transcript size and GG and GC content. Consistent with the feature analysis, alternative polyadenylation (APA) isoforms differ substantially in TiERA, with long 3’UTR isoforms generally having a higher TiERA potential than short 3’UTR isoforms. Importantly, the widespread 3’UTR lengthening taking place in cell differentiation leads to greater transcript association with ER in differentiated myotubes, despite that the TiERA potential being generally maintained. In addition, we show that TiERA correlates negatively with mRNA stability, highlighting 3’UTR-mediated mRNA decay on ER. Together, our data indicate that sequence and size features impact ER association independent of translation, leading to distinct mRNA metabolism for different transcript groups, and APA can alter transcript stability and translation through isoform-specific ER association.

Serum amlyoidosis is a protein misfolding disease which can follow chronic inflammatory conditions. Deposition of fibrils formed from serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) protein occurs systemically and can lead to severe or even fatal outcomes. Macrophages play a critical role in the misfolding and deposition of SAA1-derived fibrils and the role of macrophages in this context has been studied extensively. It is known that SAA1 can bind to some surface receptors on macrophages and it is taken up by the macrophages and metabolized in the lysosomes. On the other hand, the effect of SAA1 on macrophage physiology has been much less investigated so far. Therefore, we aim to investigate the effect of SAA1 on macrophage gene expression by gene microarray analysis. To this end, primary peritoneal macrophages from NMRI mice were treated with endotoxin-free recombinantly expressed full-length mSAA1 for 6 and 24 h and gene expression was analyzed.		50 uM mSAA1.1 in medium for 6 h;NMRI;50 uM mSAA1.1 in medium for 24 h;5.8% Ampuwa in medium for 6 h;5.8% Ampuwa in medium for 24 h;peritoneal macrophages;female;8-10

The analysis of transcriptome sequencing implied that activation of STAT3 signaling pathway by miR-337-3p might be a potential mechanism to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cell and promote metastasis under chronic stress. We also verified this biological process in further experiments. Downregulation of miR-337-3p could downregulate E-cadherin expression and upregulate vimentin expression in vitro and in vivo. STAT3, related signal pathways of which are involved in metastasis regulation, was directly targeted by miR-337-3p.

Approximately 20% of infected patients experience a severe manifestation of the disease, causing bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe COVID-19 patients also have a pronounced coagulopathy with approximately 30% of patients experiencing thromboembolic complications. However, the cellular etiology driving the coagulopathy remains unknown. Here, we explore whether the prominent neutrophilia seen in severe COVID-19 patients contributes to inflammation-associated coagulation. We found in severe patients the emergence of a CD16Int low-density inflammatory band (LDIB) neutrophil population that trends over time with changes in disease status. These cells demonstrated spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, higher phagocytic capacity, enhanced cytokine production, and associated clinically with D-dimer, ferritin, and systemic IL-6 and TNF-α levels. Strikingly, LDIB neutrophils are the major immune cells within the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid with increased CXCR3 and loss of CD44 and CD38 expression. We conclude that the LDIB subset contributes to COVID- 19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and systemic inflammation and could be used as an adjunct clinical marker to monitor disease status and progression. Identifying patients who are trending towards LDIB crisis and implementing early, appropriate treatment could improve all-cause mortality rates for severe COVID-19 patients.

Several bio-defense systems to detoxify the highly toxic MG are equipped in our body, including an enzymatic system by glyoxalase (GLO) 1 and GLO2 and a scavenge system by vitamin B6 (VB6). We have reported that some population of patients with schizophrenia shows impairment of the MG detoxification systems. Although we have evidences showing a link between impairment of MG detoxification systems and development of schizophrenia, the molecular mechanism to connect them remains poorly understood. Here, we generated a novel mouse model for MG detoxification deficits by feeding Glo1 knockout mice with VB6-lacking diets (KO/VB6(-)), and evaluate effects of impaired MG detoxification systems on brain function. KO/VB6(-) mice showed the accumulation of MG in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and striatum, and displayed schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits, such as social deficits, cognitive impairment, a sensorimotor deficit in the prepulse inhibition test. Furthermore, we found aberrant gene expression related to mitochondria function in the PFC of the KO/VB6(-) mice by RNA-seq and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Finally, we actually demonstrated respiratory deficits in mitochondria isolated from the PFC of KO/VB6(-) mice. These findings suggest that MG detoxification deficits might cause schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits via mitochondrial dysfunction in the PFC.

Here, we discover that in vivo induction of higher levels of OSKM in mouse somatic cells leads to increased expression of primordial germ cell (PGC)-related genes and provokes genome-wide erasure of genomic imprinting, which takes place exclusively in PGCs. Moreover, the in vivo OSKM reprogramming results in development of cancer that resembles human germ cell tumors. Like a subgroup of germ cell tumors, propagated tumor cells differentiate into trophoblasts. Moreover, these tumor cells give rise to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with expanded differentiation potential into trophoblasts. Remarkably, the tumor-derived iPSCs are able to contribute to non-neoplastic somatic cells in adult mice. Mechanistically, DMRT1, which is expressed in PGCs, drives the reprogramming and propagation of the tumor cells in vivo. Furthermore, the DMRT1-related epigenetic landscape is associated with trophoblast competence of the reprogrammed cells and provides a therapeutic target for germ cell tumors. These results reveal an unappreciated route for somatic cell reprogramming and underscore the impact of reprogramming in development of germ cell tumors.

Retinoic acid (RA) differentiation therapy has limited therapeutic efficacy, and the mechanisms preventing terminal differentiation remain elusive. We found that the chromatin modifier CHAF1A restricts neuronal differentiation and promotes NB oncogenesis. CHAF1A blocks NC differentiation into mature neurons in both human NCCs and zebrafish models. CHAF1A gain-of-function promotes cell malignancy, blocks RA-induced differentiation, and is sufficient to induce NB tumor formation. Mechanistically, CHAF1A blocks NB differentiation by repressing gene expression programs promoting neuronal development and differentiation, and rewiring polyamine metabolism. Targeting polyamine synthesis restores NB sensitivity to RA therapy. Our results demonstrate that CHAF1A critically contributes to NB oncogenesis by blocking neuronal differentiation and reprogramming cell metabolism.		n/a;CHAF1A overexpression;SHEP;24h;neuroblastoma;control;96h;SHEP Cells;72h

Overlapping exercise-remodeled enhancers with GWAS and cis-expression Quantitative Trait Loci data revealed enrichment with traits related to platelet function, cognitive traits and cardiovascular disease. We identify FBXW4 and PLEKHO2 as candidate genes regulated by variant-containing, exercise-responsive enhancers, and that are potentially involved in the distal modulation of brain function.

Ageing is a crucial factor that affects embryonic development and implantation.

The current study reported differential gene expression analysis among trophectoderm samples that derived from young maternal age women (YMA - below 30 years), intermediate maternal age (IMA - 30-39 years old) and advanced maternal age women (AMA - at least 40 years old). The molecular approach was assayed by a low-input next generation RNA sequencing approach. Hundreds of significantly differentially expressed transcripts were reported. Extracellular exosome-related transcripts were significantly higher in the trophectoderm cells that derived from young women. According to our analysis, several important transcripts were reported. These molecular biomarkers may have a potential role in embryonic-endometrial communication and could be used in a diagnostic setting, that could help to improve the blastocyst implantation potential.

In particular, the mechanism by which the maternal immune system does not exclude the semi-identical antigen of the fetus has not been fully answered so far. The most serious result of the maternal fetal immune tolerance balance is the recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). The fetus is rejected by the mother in the early pregnancy and cannot continue to develop in the uterus. Based on these scientific questions, we used single-cell sequencing technology to analyze nearly 30,000 leukocytes in the decidua of normal and RSA. A total of 13 immune cell subsets were found, of which dNK cells were more prominent, The lineage differentiation pathway of dNK cells was excavated, and the pathological role of dNK differentiation abnormality in the occurrence of RSA was analyzed. Our results deepen our understanding of the differentiation and function of human decidual leukocytes, especially dNK cells. We clearly recognize that the immune system has dynamic changes compared with normal pregnancy under pathological conditions, which is likely to occur in RSA.

ROS enhancement results in differentiation of LT-HSCs. Redox disturbances are involved in BM failure and leukemia. Paraoxonase-2 (PON2) has been shown to be important for ROS control. However, the role of PON2 in the hematopoietic system has not been addressed. Analysis of young mice with inactivated Pon2 gene (Pon2-/- mice; 3 months) revealed changes in quantity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which indicate changes in cell differentiation. Experiments with aged PON2-/- mice (>9 months) showed alterations of the HSPC compartment indicating changed self-renewal ability of HSCs and myeloid skewing. Reciprocal BM transplantation reveals cell intrinsic as well as extrinsic phenotypes. We observed markedly enhanced superoxide levels in BM as well as slightly enhanced total ROS level in short term (ST)-HSCs and multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) of young mice. In aged mice, total ROS level was slightly increased in all 3 fractions of the Lin-, Sca1+, ckit+ (LSK) population. No changes in the amount of DNA double-strand breaks in LSK cells and decreased apoptosis rates in LT-HSCs of young as well as LT- and ST-HSCs of aged PON2-/- mice were seen, indicating a strong compensation mechanism. Changes of gene expression in PON2-/- LT-HSCs identified by RNA sequencing strengthened our conclusions. Additionally, competitive and serial bone marrow transplantation experiments exposed advantages of PON2-/- BMCs in multi-lineage reconstitution. Collectively, these analyses propose PON2 as crucial redox control enzyme in HSCs.		young (10-14 weeks);Bone marrow;Pon2-/-;wild type;C57BL/6J;LT-HSCs

GSE179277	2021.07.19	Homo sapiens	GPL24676	TRUE	FALSE	237	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE		34462739	Upper airway transcriptional profiling reveals a more robust innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in children compared to adults	Unlike other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 disproportionately causes severe disease in older adults and only rarely in children. To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response could contribute to this disparity, we compared nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only relatively subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrated markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including TNF, IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-4 production. Cell type deconvolution confirmed greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibited a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, the primary target for SARS-CoV-2, upon infection with the virus. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.		4.396069;24925.85542;1291.57406;148.4949953;703760.606;119.1884661;296.9084958;35.9628877;503528.5993;0.3537931;0.0462577;248002.5335;421.1049763;7135.299998;1.5646051;0.5839915;0.4628878;4682.728154;97015.47568;14404.3871;387352.6412;6860.643021;0.1301704;0.6866535;432475.976;0.091255;290.0398137;11137.69827;73.8066291;3.6977687;52393.85346;0.3234513;185105.5212;271.7663891;2814.453905;313.7203046;1.164514;228.8908343;45341.08749;F;101158.668;0.201502;0.7141077;4.5602839;40.4538585;1164.629007;M;0.7124373;747784.8368;538.8761561;0.064222;8751.371606;134592.5835;0.7570937;446.0408425;0.356592;0.0798603;83.5378987;113537.752;749944.5455;0.9384323;107.1738692;1.4215762;0.4001483;829247.44;other_virus;21.4867008;0.2623271;849188.7724;560.7197335;1393.563791;61.6960155;71745.64765;0.8473272;0.2925618;241449.5708;0.1667592;17.7433752;0.2378104;2.7251186;27.3138088;0.5776178;11.7335772;0.7205765;4.4891922;611455.7008;0.1569389;16481.8769;0.1008633;142.5386354;269.0107761;0.3617566;no_virus;36.6236977;31.475878;1.2142677;1050.001686;1.7550642;2573.633733;0.085577;26.4766495;30591.34831;0.3073984;37011.34992;NP/OP swab;0.6202679;2143.324741;6378.960641;0.5096416;0.7632542;40244.38949;1358.262846;3.9089291;55958.77981;114529.5052;162623.4428;0.2167887;1912.975361;26528.37348;356.0002058;174161.8228;naso/pharyngeal swab;10.7054422;271.7674096;3.3145577;0.1143106;884.4085381;88437.7624;27.0339804;17.1031389;9077.991037;827.6899372;1.0339549;315518.1064;SC2;0.7423516;0.0699533;511357.7168;0.5145665;5541.857717;0.3209123;0.6610242;0.4539656

These changes may impact susceptibility to other infections, responsiveness to antiviral therapies, vaccine responsiveness, and development of complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has revolutionized the management of chronic HCV, with expected cure rates exceeding 95%. DAA treatment represents a unique opportunity to investigate to what extent elimination of viral replication and chronic antigen stimulation can restore immunologic phenotype. In this study we interrogated the global transcriptional profile of isolated peripheral blood T cells before, during and after IFN-free DAA therapy using single cell mRNA sequencing. Our results demonstrate that T cells mapped at single-cell resolution have dramatic transcriptomic changes early after initiation of DAA and many of these changes are sustained after completion of DAA therapy. Specifically, we see a significant reduction in transcripts associated with innate immune activation and interferon signaling such as ISG15, ISG20, IFIT3, OAS and MX1 in many different T cell subsets. Furthermore, we find an early upregulation of a gene involved in suppression of immune activation, DUSP1, in circulating T cells. Conclusion: This study provides the first in-depth transcriptomic analysis at the single-cell level of patients undergoing DAA therapy, demonstrating that IFN-free antiviral therapy in chronic HCV infection induces hitherto unrecognized shifts in innate immune and interferon signaling within T cell populations early, during, and long-term after treatment. The present study provides a rich data source to explore the effects of DAA treatment on bulk T cells.

Priming of such tumor-targeted TILs first requires recruitment of CD8+ T cells into the tumors, implying that this is an essential prerequisite of successful dMMR anti-tumor immunity. We have discovered that selective recruitment and activation of systemic CD8+ T cells into dMMR CRCs strictly depends on overexpression of CCL5 and CXCL10 due to endogenous activation of cGAS/STING and IFN signaling by damaged DNA. TIL infiltration into orthotopic dMMR CRCs is neoantigen-independent and followed by induction of a resident memory-like phenotype key to the anti-tumor response. CCL5 and CXCL10 could be upregulated by common chemotherapies in all CRCs, indicating that facilitating CD8+ T cell recruitment underlies their efficacy. Induction of CCL5 and CXCL10 thus represents a tractable therapeutic strategy to induce TIL recruitment into CRCs where local priming can be maximized even in neoantigen-poor CRCs.

They are distributed genome-widely and participate in multiple biological processes including gene transcription, and quadruplex-targeted ligands serve as potential therapeutic agents for DNA-targeted therapies. However, the roles of G-quadruplexes in transcriptional regulation remains elusive. Here, we establish a sensitive G4-CUT&Tag method for genome-wide profiling of native G-quadruplexes with high resolution and specificity. We find that native G-quadruplex signals are cell-type specific and are associated with transcriptional regulatory elements with active epigenetic modifications. Promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II pausing promotes native G-quadruplex formation, oppositely, G-quadruplex stabilization by quadruplex-targeted ligands globally reduces RNA polymerase II occupancy at gene promoters as well as nascent RNA synthesis. Moreover, G-quadruplex stabilization modulates chromatin states and impedes transcription initiation via inhibiting the loading of general transcription factors to promoters.Together, these studies reveal a reciprocal regulation between native G-quadruplex dynamics and gene transcription in the genome, which will deepen our knowledge of G-quadruplex biology towards considering therapeutically targeting G-quadruplexes in human diseases.

The lack of clinically relevant/tractable experimental models hampers therapeutic discovery. We developed a simple and robust human liver cell-based system modeling a clinical prognostic liver signature (PLS) predicting long-term liver disease progression toward HCC. Using the PLS as a readout, followed by validation in NASH-HCC animal models and patient-derived tumorspheroids, we identified nizatidine, a histamine receptor H2 (HRH2) blocker, for treatment of advanced liver disease and HCC chemoprevention. Perturbation studies combined with scRNA-Seq analyses of patient liver tissues uncovered HRH2+, CLEC5Ahigh, MARCOlow liver macrophages and hepatocytes as nizatidine targets. The PLS model combined with scRNA-Seq of patient tissues enables discovery of urgently needed targets and therapeutics for treatment of advanced liver disease and cancer prevention.

Here, we developed an inducible cell division counter (iCOUNT) that reports cell division events in human and mouse tissues in vitro and in vivo. Analysing cell division histories of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the developing and adult brain, we show that iCOUNT can provide novel insights into stem cell behaviour. Further, we used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of iCOUNT-labelled NSPCs and their progenies from the developing mouse cortex and forebrain-regionalized human organoids to identify molecular pathways that are commonly regulated between mouse and human cells, depending on individual cell division histories. Thus, we developed a novel tool to characterize the molecular consequences of repeated cell divisions of stem cells that allows an analysis of the cellular principles underlying tissue formation, homeostasis, and repair.

However, the rate of re-injury after surgery is relatively high, and collection of autologous tendons leads muscle weakness which results in prolonged rehabilitation. Here, we introduce the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-based technology aiming at developing a new therapeutic option after tendon injury.

B lymphocytes can be regulatory, yet little is known about peripheral transitional IgM+ B cells in terms of regulatory properties. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we discovered eight IgM+ B cell subsets with unique gene regulatory networks in the lung circulation dominated by transitional type 1 (T1B) and 2 (T2B) B cells. Lung intravital confocal microscopy revealed that T2B marginate in the pulmonary capillaries via CD49e and required CXCL13 and CXCR5. During lung inflammation, marginated T2B dampened excessive neutrophil vascular inflammation via the specialized proresolving molecule lipoxin A4 (LXA4). Exogenous CXCL13 dampened excessive neutrophilic inflammation by increasing marginated B cells and LXA4 recapitulated neutrophil regulation in B-cell deficient mice during inflammation and fungal pneumonia. Thus, the lung microvasculature is enriched in multiple IgM+ B cell subsets with marginating capillary T2B that dampen neutrophil responses.		lung;CD45+;Ly6Gcre: tdTomato mice;Rodent Lung;C57BL/6J;10X Genomics Single Cell RNAseq v3

To assess the relative biological activity and potency of BPA and structural analogs BPS, BPF and TBBP, we examined the stem cell transcriptome in H9 hES cells following exposure to these chemicals at concentrations that covered greater than three orders of magnitude (1 microM to >100 microM). These exposure levels are considered to be near human relevant and range from noncytotoxic to overtly toxic. Overall, this study provides basic mechanistic information about the effects of BPA and structural analogs BPS, BPF and TBBP on the transcriptome of hES cells and demonstrates how these data can be applied to derive benchmark dose modeling (BMD) information useful for comparing relative potencies of these structurally related chemicals.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in developed countries, making up a third of the mortality rate in the US1. Congenital heart defects (CHD) affect ~1% of all live births2, making it the common birth defect in humans. Current technologies provide some insight into how these disorders originate but are limited in their ability to provide a complete overview of disease pathogenesis and progression due to their lack of physiological complexity. There is a pressing need to develop more faithful organ-like platforms recapitulating complex in vivo phenotypes to study human development and disease in vitro. Here, we report the most faithful in vitro organoid model of human cardiovascular development to date using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Our protocol is highly efficient, scalable, shows high reproducibility and is compatible with high-throughput approaches. Furthermore, our hHOs showed very high similarity to human fetal hearts, both morphologically and in cell-type complexity. hHOs were differentiated using a two-step manipulation of Wnt signaling using chemical inhibitors and growth factors in completely defined media and culture conditions. Organoids were successfully derived from multiple independent hPSCs lines with very similar efficiency. hHOs started beating at ~6 days, were mostly spherical and grew up to ~1 mm in diameter by day 15 of differentiation. hHOs developed sophisticated, interconnected internal chambers and confocal analysis for cardiac markers revealed the presence of all major cardiac lineages, including cardiomyocytes (TNNT2+), epicardial cells (WT1+, TJP+), cardiac fibroblasts (THY1+, VIM+), endothelial cells (PECAM1+), and endocardial cells (NFATC1+). Morphologically, hHOs developed well-defined epicardial and adjacent myocardial regions and presented a distinct vascular plexus as well as endocardial-lined microchambers. RNA-seq time-course analysis of hHOs, monolayer differentiated iPSCs and fetal human hearts revealed that hHOs recapitulate human fetal heart tissue development better than previously described differentiation protocols.  hHOs allow higher-order interaction of distinct heart tissues for the first time, and display biologically relevant physical and topographical 3D cues that closely resemble the human fetal heart. Our model constitutes a powerful novel tool for discovery and translational studies in human cardiac development and disease.

GSE139900	2021.07.19	Homo sapiens	GPL20301	TRUE	FALSE	24	Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing	FALSE		34376242	Therapeutic manipulation of SRSF1 mitigates genome-wide transcriptome alterations and neuronal hyperexcitability in C9ORF72-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	Loss of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) leads to relentless paralysis and death usually within a few years from symptom onset. Thousands of RNA molecules with roles in multiple cellular pathways are compromised in disease challenging the identification of alterations causing pathogenesis over downstream changes consequent to neurodegeneration. We recently showed that partial depletion of SR-rich splicing factor SRSF1 inhibits the nuclear export of pathological C9ORF72-repeat transcripts and subsequent translation of dipeptide-repeat proteins in patient-derived neurons and Drosophila, providing in turn a promising strategy of neuroprotection for the most common form of ALS. While the roles of SRSF1 remain poorly characterised in neurons, its therapeutic manipulation offers a rare opportunity to identify disease-modifying gene expression changes. Here, we report diseased and neuroprotected transcriptomes from human-derived neurons and Drosophila heads. Strikingly, while the depletion of SRSF1 has limited effects on genome-wide expression, splicing and nuclear export of RNAs, reversal of 90 disease-modifying transcripts were identified over 2,000 RNA changes in human disease. Functional validation further demonstrated that conserved potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated KCNN channel inhibitors mitigate C9ORF72-ALS mediated hyperexcitability and death of human motor neurons as well as Drosophila motor deficits. Our data support efficacy and safety of SRSF1 manipulation as a therapeutic approach leading to rescue of multiple biological processes without disrupting neuronal transcriptomes. In addition to a potential new therapeutic target for pharmacological inhibition, we also identified in vitro and in vivo disease-modifying gene expression signatures to guide the development of new biomarkers and novel therapeutic approaches in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD.

Complicated lineage specification in placental trophoblast cells finally forms the functional placenta. However, at which stage the fate of mouse trophoblast lineages is determined key open questions. Lineage tracing is the most reliable approach to study cell fate determination. Herein, we took advantage of a fluorescent Cre recombinase reporter mouse for our lineage tracing experiments. Cell labeling experiments were performed by microinjection of Cre mRNA into single blastomere respectively at the two-, four- and eight-cell stage, and increasing bias of the labeled cell distribution was observed in the E12.5 fetus and placenta, which was also supported by the single cell sequencing results.Together, our data provide direct evidence supporting the idea that the first cell fate choice of early blastomeres, toward the inner cell mass (ICM) or trophoblast fate, has become determined at the four-cell stage, and three different cell fates may exist among the four blastomeres.Compared with previous studies, it is the first study to trace the cell lineages from early stages over such a long developmental period.
