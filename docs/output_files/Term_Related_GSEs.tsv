Lentiviral transduction creates multiple types of mutations due to the error-prone nature of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). We optimized and leveraged this property to identify drug resistance mutations, a technique we term LentiMutate. After validating this technique by identifying clinically relevant EGFR resistance mutations, we applied this technique to two additional anti-cancer drugs, imatinib and AMG 510. We find novel deletions in BCR-ABL1 that confer resistance to BCR-ABL1 inhibitors and point mutations in the AMG 510 binding pocket or oncogenic non-G12C mutations, in KRAS-G12C or wild-type KRAS, respectively, that confer resistance to AMG 510. LentiMutate may prove highly valuable to clinical and preclinical cancer drug development.

To examine the toxicity, we monitored genome-wide gene expression changes in human lung BEAS-2B cells, exposed for 4h and 24h to a subtoxic dose of each PM extract. After 4h exposure, numerous dysregulated genes and processes such as oxidative stress, lipid and steroid metabolism, PPARα signaling and immune response, were found to be common for both extract treatments. Twenty four hour exposure resulted in more distinctive gene expression patterns. Although several common modulated processes indicating the metabolism of PAHs and activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) were identified, E15 specifically dysregulated a variety of other genes and pathways related to cancer promotion and progression, possibly due to the increased PAH content in PM organic extract.		lung;organic extract of non-exposed filter;organic extract of PM from E15;organic extract of PM from E0;epithelial cells;BEAS-2B;lung epithelial cells

We identified Nox4 as the major ROS generating enzyme whose expression is induced during differentiation of embryoid body (EB) into cells of all three germ layers. The role of Nox4 was examined using iPS cells generated from Nox4 -/- mouse. Differentiation markers showed significantly reduced expression levels consistent with the importance of Nox4-generated ROS during this process. From transcriptomic analyses, we found insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a member of a gene family extensively involved in embryonic development, as one of the most down-regulated genes. Indeed, addition of IGF2 to culture partly restored the differentiation efficiency of Nox4-/- iPS cells. Our results reveal an important signaling axis mediated by ROS in control of crucial events during differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.

Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs available that slow NASH progression or address NASH liver involvement in COVID-19. Since animal models cannot fully recapitulate human NASH, we hypothesized that stem cells isolated directly from end-stage NASH patient liver may address current knowledge gaps in human NASH pathology. Approach and Results: We devised methods allowing derivation, proliferation, hepatic differentiation and extensive characterization of bipotent ductal organoids from irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver. The transcriptomes of organoids derived from NASH liver, but not healthy liver show significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory and cytochrome p450-related pathways, as well as of known liver fibrosis and tumor markers, with the degree of upregulation being NASH patient-specific.		total RNA isolated by TRIZOL procedure;direct RNA isolation from liver;FDD healthy female  liver,  living donor;NASH5 female liver explant;MLD healthy male  liver,  living donor;NASH 2 male  liver explant;cirrhotic NASH human liver;NASH1 male liver explant;NASH6 male  liver explant;NASH explant liver;CF cystic fibropsis female liver explant;12d hepatic differentiation of biliary organoids;cystic fibropsis human liver;FDD healthy female  liver,  deceased donor;NASH5 female  liver explant;alcoholic cirrhosis  human liver;AC alcoholic cirrhosis  female liver explant;NASH3 male  liver explant;hepatic organoids;FDD healthy female  liver, deceased donor;NASH4 male  liver explant;female;male;healthy human liver

It remains unclear how keratinocytes process physiologic signals generated during skin irritation and switch from a homeostatic to an inflammatory state. This gene expression analysis shows that the stress-activated protein kinase p38{alpha} is crucial for keratinocytes to prompt changes in their transcriptome upon cytokine stimulation.

This disease is three times more common in women, yet more severe in men, but the mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain largely unknown. MS is initiated by autoreactive T helper cells, but CNS-resident and CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells are the key proximal effector cells regulating disease pathology. We have previously shown that genetic ablation of p38α MAP kinase broadly in the myeloid lineage is protective in the autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), but only in females, and not males. To precisely define the mechanisms responsible, we used multiple genetic approaches and bone marrow chimeras to ablate p38α in microglial cells, peripheral myeloid cells, or both. Deletion of p38α in both cell types recapitulated the previous sex difference, with reduced EAE severity in females. Unexpectedly, deletion of p38α in the periphery was protective in both sexes. In contrast, deletion of p38α in microglia exacerbated EAE in males only, revealing opposing roles of p38α in microglia vs. periphery. Bulk transcriptional profiling revealed that p38α regulated the expression of distinct gene modules in male vs. female microglia. Single-cell transcriptional analysis of WT and p38α-deficient microglia isolated from the inflamed CNS revealed a diversity of complex microglial states, connected by distinct convergent transcriptional trajectories. Microglial p38α deficiency in males resulted in enhanced transition from homeostatic to disease-associated microglial states, with the downregulation of regulatory genes such as Atf3, Rgs1, Socs3, and Btg2, and increased expression of inflammatory genes such as Cd74, Trem2, and MHC class I and II genes. Taken together, these results reveal the presence of a p38α-dependent male-specific molecular pathway in microglia that is protective in CNS autoimmunity, suggesting that autoimmunity in males and females is driven by distinct cellular and molecular pathways, thus informing the design of novel future sex-specific therapeutic approaches.		microglia, female CKO;microglia, female WT;microglia, male WT;wildtype;pooled brain and spinal cord, D21 post EAE induction;p38 CKO;microglia, male CKO;female;C57BL/6;male

The mechanisms balancing adrenal hormone-producing cells and protecting against neuroblastoma or other tumors are still enigmatic. Here we revealed that adrenergic chromaffin cells release serotonin (5HT), which acts upon their immediate progenitor “bridge” cells via 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A (HTR3A). Consistently, the aggressive HTR3Ahigh human neuroblastoma cell lines reduce proliferation in response to HTR3A-specific agonists, suggesting the mechanism of anti-tumor protection. Physiological increase of 5HT in vivo caused prolongation of a cell cycle length in “bridge” progenitors leading to smaller chromaffin population and changing the balance of hormones and behavioral patterns in resulting adult rodents. These behavioral effects and smaller adrenals were mirrored in a progeny of pregnant females subjected to experimental stress, suggesting novel maternal-fetal link controlling developmental adaptations. Finally, these findings corresponded to a size-distribution of adrenals found in wild rodents with different coping strategies.

Microglial function is tightly controlled, but under certain pathological conditions, activated microglia can induce excess inflammation which injure live cells in the CNS. Therefore, suppression of microglia is a fundamental strategy to treat CNS disorders. We have previously shown that the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) inhibits microglia activation, but mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to identify a target of LEV to suppress microglial activity.		untreated;BV-2;microglia cell line;LPS for 6 hr;LPS+LEV for 6 hr

RNA-Sequencing was performed on bulk isolated populations Results: We identified Ly6GIntermediate as bona-fide immature neutrophils and analysis of Ly6G expression level as a consistently accurate marker of identifying neutrophil maturity. Gene expression was influenced by maturation stage, tissue of isolation, developmental niche and pathology.

Methods: Ten ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mice were used for the establishment of dyslipidemic disease-syndrome models via multifactor-hybrid modeling, with 5 in the the PDR group and 5 in the SKYD group. Five C57BL/6J mice were employed as normal controls (NC) group, which is not included in the current records.. Test model quality. Aortic endothelial macrophages in mice were screened using flow cytometry. Transcriptomic analysis was performed for macrophages using RNA-Seq. Results: The quality assessment of the disease-syndrome model showed that TG, TC, and LDL-C levels significantly increased in the PDR and SKYD groups versus the NC group (P < 0.05). Combined with HE staining of aorta, the disease model was successfully established. The quality assessment of the syndrome models showed that mice in the PDR group presented with typical manifestations of the PDR syndrome, and mice in the SKYD group had the related manifestations of the SKYD syndrome, indicating that the syndrome models were successfully constructed. After comparing the differentially expressed gene (DEG) expressions in macrophages in dyslipidemia mice with different syndromes, 4142 genes were identified with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis for the DEGs showed that biological process of difference between PDR group and SKYD group include both adverse and protective processes were included. Conclusion: The DEGs between the PDR syndrome and the SKYD syndrome indicate different biological mechanisms between the onset of the two syndromes. They have distinctive biological processes, including adverse and protective processes, corresponding to the invasion of pathogenic factors into the body and the fight of healthy qi against pathogenic factors, respectively, in the TCM theory. Our results have demonstrated the biological evidence behind ‘treating the same disease with different treatments’ in TCM.

Six patients experienced a rapid fatal recurrence (RR) and other 6 had later non-fatal recurrences (LR). Before NAT, RR had low expression of 6 MHC class I and 13 MHC class II genes but were enriched in upregulated genes involved in the cell cycle-related pathways. Their TIL number before NAT in RR was very low (<5%) and did not increase after treatment. In post-NAT residual tumors, RR cases showed high expression of SOX2 and CXCR4. Our results indicate that high expression of cell cycle genes, combined with cold immunological phenotype, may predict strong TNBC resistance to NAT and rapid progression after it. This biomarker combination is worth validation in larger studies.		frozen tumor tissue;IIA;IIB;IIIA;breast

Chronic MS patients exhibit impaired remyelination capacity, partly due to the changes that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) undergo in response to the MS lesion environment. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is present in the MS affected CNS and has been implicated in disease pathophysiology. Of the two active forms of TNF, transmembrane (tmTNF) and soluble (solTNF), tmTNF signals via TNFR2 mediating protective and reparative effects, including remyelination, whereas solTNF signals predominantly via TNFR1 promoting neurotoxicity. To better understand the mechanisms underlying repair failure in MS, we investigated the cellular responses of OPCs to inflammatory exposure and the specific role of TNFR2 signaling in their modulation. Following treatment of cultured OPCs with IFNg, IL1b and TNF we observed by RNA sequencing marked inflammatory and immune activation of OPCs, accompanied by metabolic changes and dysregulation of their proliferation and differentiation programming. We also established the high likelihood of cell-cell interaction between OPCs and microglia in neuroinflammatory conditions, with OPCs able to produce chemokines that can recruit and activate microglia. Importantly, we showed that these functions are exacerbated when TNFR2 is ablated. Together, our data indicate that neuroinflammation leads OPCs to shift towards an immunomodulatory phenotype while diminishing their capacity to proliferate and differentiate, thus impairing their repair function. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TNFR2 plays a key role in this process, suggesting that boosting TNFR2 activation or its downstream signals could be an effective strategy to restore OPC reparative capacity in demyelinating disease.

Here, we present a novel report showing a tailored stem cell-based therapy which can aid in viral clearance and rescue liver and blood vessels cells from further damage during dengue infection by administering combination of hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells and dental pulp stem cells in a dengue virus-infected BALB/c mouse model. To analyze the molecular level changes induced by DENV infection and stem cell treatment in dengue-infected mice, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using MiSeq next-generation sequencing was employed in this study. Transcriptomics analysis was performed comparing gene expression patterns in different experimental groups. Methods: Liver mRNA profiles of 21-day-old healthy, Dengue virus infected, and dengue infected plus stem cells treated BALB/C mice were generated by sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Miseq V3 150. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were assembled and analyzed using Tuxedo software. The results were analyzed using Cuffdiff to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts. The relative expression of genes was determined based on FPKM (total fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads) values Results: After analysis, it was found that 59 genes were significantly up-regulated in the DVI group, and in the DVI-SCT group, 47 of the genes were successfully corrected to the level similar to that of control group, while the remaining genes showed down-regulation Conclusion: In the recent years, the incidence of dengue has continued to increase, but there is currently no rapid and effective treatment available. This study demonstrates stem cell therapy as a promising management to reduce the global burden of dengue.

Resistance occurs when mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) render anti-androgen drugs ineffective or when constitutively active splice variants lacking the androgen binding domain entirely (e.g. ARV7) is expressed. In this study, we are reporting the discovery of novel AR-NTD covalent inhibitor 1‐chloro‐3‐[(5‐([(2S)‐3‐chloro‐2‐hydroxypropyl]amino)naphthalen‐1‐yl)amino]propan‐2‐ol (VPC-220010) targeting the AR-N-terminal Domain (AR-NTD). VPC-220010 inhibits AR-mediated transcription of full length and truncated variant ARV7, downregulates AR response genes, and selectively reduces the growth of both full-length AR- and truncated AR-dependent prostate cancer cell lines. We show that VPC-220010 disrupts interactions between AR and its known coactivators and interactors, such as CHD4, FOXA1, ZMIZ1, and several SWI/SNF complex proteins. Taken together, our data suggest that VPC-220010 is a promising small molecule AR-NTD inhibitor for the treatment of CRPC.		LNCaP cells

Dysregulated ammonia metabolism initiates a hyperammonemic stress response (HASR). Hyperammonemia occurs in many chronic diseases but there is limited understanding of the overall consequences of HASR. A comprehensive array of unbiased approaches was used to identify global responses during hyperammonemia with experimental validation of critical findings. Protein/gene expression and chromatin accessibility in hyperammonemic murine myotubes and mouse skeletal muscle tissue were analyzed by quantitative proteomics, RNA sequencing (RNAseq), and Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (ATACseq). Unique clusters of expression/accessibility changes were identified in hyperammonemic myotubes. In hyperammonemic mouse muscle and myotubes, we identified enrichment of pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation, calcium signaling, hypoxia inducible factor-1, and apoptosis and regulation of protein synthesis were altered during HASR and were experimentally validated. Enrichment of senescence signaling and glycosylation pathways during HASR were novel observations. Comparisons with RNAseq data from skeletal muscle from human patients with cirrhosis revealed similar perturbations, demonstrating the translational relevance of our observations. We identified several novel regulatory pathways during HASR that are conserved in different models and across species, and whose dysregulation could significantly impact skeletal muscle structure and function.

Dysregulated ammonia metabolism initiates a hyperammonemic stress response (HASR). Hyperammonemia occurs in many chronic diseases but there is limited understanding of the overall consequences of HASR. A comprehensive array of unbiased approaches was used to identify global responses during hyperammonemia with experimental validation of critical findings. Protein/gene expression and chromatin accessibility in hyperammonemic murine myotubes and mouse skeletal muscle tissue were analyzed by quantitative proteomics, RNA sequencing (RNAseq), and Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (ATACseq). Unique clusters of expression/accessibility changes were identified in hyperammonemic myotubes. In hyperammonemic mouse muscle and myotubes, we identified enrichment of pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation, calcium signaling, hypoxia inducible factor-1, and apoptosis and regulation of protein synthesis were altered during HASR and were experimentally validated. Enrichment of senescence signaling and glycosylation pathways during HASR were novel observations. Comparisons with RNAseq data from skeletal muscle from human patients with cirrhosis revealed similar perturbations, demonstrating the translational relevance of our observations. We identified several novel regulatory pathways during HASR that are conserved in different models and across species, and whose dysregulation could significantly impact skeletal muscle structure and function.

While both NAMPT and NMNAT1 were required for AML, we found that the presence of NAD+ precursors bypassed the dependence of AML on NAMPT, but not NMNAT1, pointing to NMNAT1 as a gatekeeper of NAD+ biosynthesis. We provide evidence that reduced nuclear NAD+ upon deletion of NMNAT1 activated p53, which is due to attenuated deacetylation by SIRT6/7 in AML cells. Our findings reveal that NAD+ is a critical metabolic foundation for AML, and NMNAT1 is a novel therapeutic target for this disease.		AML;negative control;acute myeloid leukemia;NMNAT1;Blood

We recently discovered that additional modulation of signaling pathways with small molecules facilitates reprogramming to more primitive induced muscle progenitor cells (iMPCs). However, the mechanisms by which a single transcription factor drives differentiated cells into distinct developmental states remain unknown. We therefore dissected the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of fibroblasts undergoing MyoD-dependent reprogramming to either myotubes or iMPCs using a novel MyoD transgenic model. To this end, we performed single cell RNA sequencing for Pax7-nGFP positive iMPCs/satellite cells and cells undergoing dedifferentiation (i.e. Dox+FRG) or transdifferentiation (i.e. Dox) Our analyses elucidate the role of MyoD in myogenic reprogramming and derive general principles by which transcription factors and signaling pathways cooperate to rewire cell identity. Our results may also inform on potential therapeutic applications of direct reprogramming.

The mechanisms underlying colitis pathogenicity and anti-TNF therapy resistance are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that RORα is highly expressed in active UC patients, particularly in those non-responsive to anti-TNF treatment. Rorα deficient CD4+ T cells could not induce severe gut inflammation in a T cell transfer colitis model. Mechanistically, RORα regulated T cell infiltration in colon by promoting T cell migration and inhibiting T cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, genome-wide occupancy and transcriptome analysis revealed that RORα promoted mTORC1 activation. mTORC1 signaling, also hyperactivated in active UC patients, was necessary for T cell-mediated colitis.

Several studies have shown that high CD276 expression in cancer cells correlates with a poor clinical prognosis. This has been associated with the presence of lower tumor infiltrating leukocytes. Among those, tumor-associated macrophages can comprise up to 50% of the tumor mass and are thought to support tumor growth through various mechanisms. However, a lack of information on CD276 function and interaction partner(s) impedes rigorous evaluation of CD276 as a therapeutic target in oncology. Therefore, we aimed to understand the relevance of CD276 in tumor-macrophage interaction by employing a 3D spheroid coculture system with human cells. Our data show a role for tumor-expressed CD276 on the macrophage recruitment into the tumor spheroid, and also in regulation of the extracellular matrix modulator PAI-1. Furthermore, our experiments focusing on macrophage-expressed CD276 suggest that the antibody-dependent CD276 engagement triggers predominantly inhibitory signaling networks in human macrophages.

This study aimed to investigate differentially expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with pSS to identify lncRNAs that affect pSS pathogenesis. Transcriptome sequencing detected 38096 lncRNAs and 50869 mRNAs in PBMCs from patients with pSS and healthy individuals. The differentially expressed mRNAs underwent functional enrichment analysis. A protein interaction relationship (PPI) and ceRNA network was constructed. LncRNA expression in patients with pSS and controls was determined using RT-PCR. 1180 lncRNAs and 640 mRNAs were differentially expressed in pSS patients (fold change > 2 in healthy persons). The PPI network was constructed with 640 mRNAs and a ceRNA network with four key lncRNAs (GABPB1-AS1, PSMA3-AS1, LINC00847 and SNHG1). A co-expression relationship was found between GABPB1-AS1 and several upregulated mRNAs (IFI44, IFI44L, IFI6, and EPSTI1). RT-PCR revealed that GABPB1-AS1 and PSMA3-AS1 were significantly upregulated 3.0- and 1.4-fold in the pSS group, respectively. In patients with pSS, the GABPB1-AS1 expression level was positively correlated with B cell and IgG levels. GABPB1-AS1 expression levels are positively correlated with B cell levels and may be involved in the pathogenesis of pSS.

This is the case for Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) in the retina, which transmit visual information to the brain via axons projecting into the optic nerve. RGCs are unable to regenerate their axon after injury, and start a degeneration process that leads to cell death and loss of vision. To identifying molecular mechanisms that increase regeneration of RGC and may offer new treatment strategies for patients with glaucoma or other types of optic neuropathies, we focused on the identification of transcription factors and chromatin accessible sites that are enriched in RGC during developmental stages, in which axon growth capacity is robust. We find that stage-specific gene expression changes are correlated with temporal changes in promoter chromatin accessibility. We also find that Creb binding motifs are enriched in the differentially opened regions of the chromatin at embryonic developmental stage. Overexpression of active Creb promotes axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Our results provide a map of the chromatin accessibility during RGC development and highlights that manipulating TF associated with developmental stages can stimulate axon growth in adulthood.		embryonic E21 day;retina;Retinal Ganglion Cell;postnatal day P11

In this work, we show a new role for ETV7, a transcriptional repressor member of the ETS family, in promoting breast cancer stem-like cells plasticity and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy in breast cancer (BC) cells. We observed that MCF7 and T47D BC-derived cells stably over-expressing ETV7 showed reduced sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug 5-Flouororuacil and to radiotherapy, accompanied by an adaptive proliferative behavior observed in different culture conditions. We further noticed that alteration of ETV7 expression could significantly affect the population of breast CSCs, measured by CD44+/CD24low cell population and mammosphere formation efficiency. By transcriptome profiling, we identified a signature of Interferon-responsive genes significantly repressed in cells over-expressing ETV7, which could be responsible for the increase in the breast CSCs population, as this could be partially reverted by the treatment with IFN-b. Lastly, we show that the expression of the IFN-responsive genes repressed by ETV7 could have prognostic value in breast cancer, as low expression of these genes was associated with a worse prognosis. Therefore, we propose a novel role for ETV7 in breast cancer stem cells’ plasticity and associated resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which involves the repression of a group of IFN-responsive genes, potentially reversible upon IFN-b treatment. We, therefore, suggest that an in-depth investigation of this mechanism could lead to novel breast CSCs targeted therapies and to the improvement of combinatorial regimens, possibly involving the therapeutic use of IFN-b, with the aim of avoiding resistance development and relapse in breast cancer.

Combining DNA and RNA sequencing, 756 patients were studied, and KRAS was observed as the most frequently mutated gene in patients at diagnosis; in addition, we demonstrated the persistence or de novo occurrence or the KRAS aberration at disease relapse. After several decades of effort, small molecule inhibitors targeting KRAS have emerged and are showing promising activity in clinical trials. However, these inhibitors are selective for tumors carrying that KRASG12C mutation and will only treat a subset of patients, predominantly with lung or colon tumors where this mutation is most prevalent. Therefore, there is still a need to develop novel therapeutic approachesto target the KRAS mutational events found in other tumor types, including MM. AZD4785, is a potent and selectivetherapeutic antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), tested in phase I clinical trials, which selectively targets and down-regulates all KRAS isoforms.

Remarkably, exosomes secreted by cells into body fluids contain molecules that reflect the disease information, and urinary exosomes could be used to detect prostate cancer as a new type of liquid biopsies. Non-coding RNAs are enriched and stable in exosomes.

A holistic understanding of how individual small molecules affect this balance is essential to anticipate immune-related side effects, select mitigating immunomodulatory therapies and highlight novel utility as immunomodulators. We previously showed that the high-specificity, low-toxicity cyclin dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) inhibitor DCA promotes tolerogenic effects in innate immune cells. Here, we demonstrate that DCA exerts a novel profile of tolerogenic activity on CD4+ T cells, promoting Treg and Th2 while inhibiting Th1 and Th17 differentiation. DCA enhances human Treg differentiation and our models demonstrate clear tolerogenic function of DCA-driven Tregs in the absence of confounding contribution from DCA-innate immune interactions. DCA engages unique mechanisms, including specifically enhancing early Foxp3 expression via regulating c-Jun phosphorylation, to promote Treg differentiation. CDK8 inhibitors are currently being developed to treat cancer; our findings suggest that the potential blunting of host-versus-tumor effects may warrant ancillary pro-inflammatory agents. Importantly, these results highlight novel utility of DCA as an immunomodulator, not only in vivo, but also in ex vivo cellular therapy.		2019-01-28;CD3/28;2019-02-01;none;M;2019-01-30;CD62L+ GFP- CD4+;GFP- CD4+;2 ng/mL TGFB;10 ng/mL TGFB;Sorted Cells;GFP+ CD4+;4 day;DCA + 2 ng/mL TGFB;naive;2 day

Recent GWAS’s have identified an intergenic region associated with both enhanced cognitive performance and bipolar disorder. This region contains dozens of putative fetal brain-specific enhancers and is located ~0.7 Mb upstream of the neuronal transcription factor POU3F2. We identified a candidate causal variant, rs77910749, that falls within a highly conserved putative enhancer, LC1. This human-specific variant is a single-base deletion in a PAX6 binding site and is predicted to be functional. We hypothesized that rs77910749 alters LC1 activity and hence POU3F2 expression during neurodevelopment. Indeed, transgenic reporter mice demonstrated LC1 activity in the developing cerebral cortex and amygdala. Furthermore, ex vivo reporter assays in embryonic mouse brain and human iPSC-derived cerebral organoids revealed increased enhancer activity conferred by the variant. To probe the in vivo function of LC1, we deleted the orthologous mouse region, which resulted in amygdala-specific changes in Pou3f2 expression. Lastly, ‘humanized’ rs77910749 knock-in mice displayed behavioral defects in sensory gating, an amygdala-dependent endophenotype seen in patients with bipolar disorder.

Despite the extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations of monoaminergic neurons, the subcellular localization of protein synthesis has not been well-characterized in these populations. Here, we investigated mRNA localization in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, cells with enormous axonal and dendritic projections, both of which can release dopamine (DA). Using highly-sensitive sequencing and imaging approaches in mDA axons, we found no evidence for axonal mRNA localization or translation. In contrast, we found that mDA neuronal dendritic projections into the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we found dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicular release proteins in mDA neurons. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA transmission from dendrites, but not striatal axons. Finally, we defined a molecular signature of sparse mDA neurons in the SNr, including enrichment of an ER calcium pump previously undescribed in mDA neurons.

Beyond the conserved set of genes regulating anti-cancer immunity we identified Rnf31 and Vps4b as essential factors required for escaping CD8+ T cell-killing. While the absence of Rnf31 induced sensitivity to T cell killing through TNF-mediated apoptosis in murine cancer cells and human PDA organoids, loss of Vps4b abrogated functional autophagy, resulting in accumulation of CD8+ T cell-derived granzyme B and subsequent tumor cell lysis.

Despite such importance, mesenchymal cell types are poorly defined morphologically and molecularly, lagging behind their counterparts in the epithelial, endothelial, and immune lineages. Leveraging single-cell RNA-seq, three-dimensional imaging, and lineage tracing, we classify the mouse lung mesenchyme into three proximal-distal axes that are associated with the endothelium, epithelium, and interstitium, respectively. From proximal to distal, (1) the vascular axis includes vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes that transition as arterioles and venules ramify into capillaries; (2) the epithelial axis includes airway smooth muscle cells and two populations of myofibroblasts: ductal myofibroblasts, surrounding alveolar ducts and marked by CDH4, HHIP, and LGR6, which persist post-alveologenesis, and alveolar myofibroblasts, surrounding alveoli and marked by high expression of PDGFRA, which undergo developmental apoptosis; (3) the interstitial axis, residing between the epithelial and vascular trees and sharing a newly-identified marker MEOX2, includes fibroblasts in the bronchovascular bundle and the alveolar interstitium that are marked by IL33 and Wnt2, respectively. Single-cell imaging reveals distinct morphology of each mesenchymal cell population. This classification provides a conceptual and experimental framework applicable to other organs.

Here, we characterized single-cell transcriptional profiles of the mouse left ventricular cellular landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (10×Genomics). Detailed t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) analysis revealed the cell types of left ventricle with gene markers. Left ventricular cellulome contained cardiomyocytes highly expressed Trdn, endothelial cells highly expressed Pcdh17, fibroblast highly expressed Lama2 and macrophages highly expressed Hpgds, also proved by in situ hybridization. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analysis (ListHits>2, p<0.05) were employed with the DAVID database to investigate subtypes of each cell type with the underlying functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Endothelial cells included five subtypes, fibroblasts comprised of seven subtypes and macrophages contained eleven subtypes. The key representative DEGs (p<0.001) are Gja4 and Gja5 in cluster 3 of endothelial cells, Aqp2 and Thbs4 in cluster 2 of fibroblasts, as well as Clec4e and Trem-1 in in cluster 3 of marcophages perhaps involved in the occur of atherosclerosis, heart failure and acute myocardial infarction proved by literature review. We also revealed extensive networks of intercellular communication in left ventricle. We suggested possible therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease and autocrine and paracrine signaling underpins left ventricular homeostasis. This study provides new insights into the structure and function of the mammalian left ventricular cellulome and offers an important resource that will stimulate studies in cardiovascular research.		left ventricle;12 weeks old;heart;C57BL/6

CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing has been used to correct DMD mutations in animal models at young ages. However, the longevity and durability of CRISPR/Cas9 editing remained to be determined. To address these issues, we subjected DEx44 DMD mice to systemic delivery of AAV9 expressing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing components to reframe exon 45 of the dystrophin gene, allowing robust dystrophin expression and maintenance of muscle structure and function. We showed that genome correction by CRISPR/Cas9 confers lifelong expression of dystrophin in mice and that corrected skeletal muscle is highly durable and resistant to myofiber necrosis and fibrosis, even in response to chronic injury. In contrast, when muscle fibers were ablated by barium chloride injection, satellite cells were unable to restore dystrophin expression due to restriction of gene editing components. Analysis of on-target and off-target gene editing in aged mice confirmed the stability of gene correction and the lack of significant off-target editing at 18 months of age. These findings demonstrate the long-term durability of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing as a therapy for maintaining the integrity and function of DMD muscle, even under conditions of stress.

Therefore, exploring its potential pathogenesis and developing effective treatment approaches for AMI have become a research hotspot in the medical community. In the present study, clinical blood samples from patients with AMI were analyzed and the results showed that the expression of microRNA (miR)-124 was significantly increased in peripheral blood of patients with AMI compared with healthy subjects. In addition, miR-124 overexpression notably promoted the apoptosis of HUVECs and attenuated their proliferative ability. Based on these findings, RNA from HUVECs was extracted and sequenced to investigate the changes in the gene expression profile triggered by miR-124 overexpression. The upregulated genes were enriched in several signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, while the downregulated ones were mainly enriched in metabolic-related signaling pathways. Additionally, the chromosomal location analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were distributed in all chromosomes, except the Y sex chromosome. Furthermore, the characteristic profile of DEGs mediated by miR-124 overexpression was analyzed via Connectivity Map analysis. The analysis revealed that anisomycin and sanguinarine, two agonists of the p38/MAPK signaling pathway involved in the inhibition of angiogenesis, exerted the highest enrichment scores. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis demonstrated that DEGs were mainly enriched in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thus inhibiting angiogenesis. Collectively, the present results indicated that miR-124 overexpression could promote AMI by affecting angiogenesis.		huvec transfect with empty plasmid;huvec transfect with micro 124 expression plasmid;HUVEC

Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry to define the “lipidome” in prostate tumors with matched benign tissues (n=21), independent unmatched tissues (n=47), and primary prostate explants cultured with the clinical AR antagonist enzalutamide (n=43). Significant differences in lipid composition were detected and spatially visualized in tumors compared to matched benign samples. Notably, tumors featured higher proportions of monounsaturated lipids overall and elongated fatty acid chains in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine lipids. Significant associations between lipid profile and malignancy were validated in unmatched samples, and phospholipid composition was characteristically altered in patient tissues that responded to AR inhibition. Importantly, targeting tumor-related lipid features via inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 significantly reduced cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in tissue explants (n=13). This first characterization of the prostate cancer lipidome in clinical tissues reveals enhanced fatty acid synthesis, desaturation and elongation as tumor-defining features, with potential for therapeutic targeting.

Recent studies have suggested a sexually dimorphic role of microglia in the maintenance of neuropathic pain in rodents. Here, we utilized RNA sequencing analysis of microglia to identify whether there is a common neuropathic microglial signature and characterize the sex differences in microglia in pain-related regions in nerve injury and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy mouse models. Whilst mechanical allodynia and behavioral changes were observed in all models, transcriptomic analysis of microglia revealed no common transcriptional changes in spinal and supraspinal regions and in different neuropathic models. However, there was a substantial change in microglial gene expression within the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord 7-days after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Both sexes upregulated genes associated with inflammation, phagosome, and lysosome activation, though males revealed a prominent global transcriptional shift not observed in female mice. This study demonstrates a lack of a common neuropathic microglial signature and indicates distinct sex differences in spinal microglia, suggesting they contribute to the sex-specific pain processing following nerve injury.

However, it is unclear whether the decline in fertility of reproductively old males is related to the alterations of the sp and sEV which may have compromised effect on the immune microenvironment of the female uterus. In this research, we found a decrease in the implantation rate of pseudo-pregnant female mice which was treated with sp from reproductively old male mice (aged-sp group) than sp from young male mice (young-sp group). RNA-sequence analysis revealed an increase in the expression level of local cytokines and chemokines in the uterus of aged-sp groups than those of young-sp groups. Further in vitro experiments found an induction of dendritic cells (DC) maturation in the aged-sp groups. After isolating and characterizing sEV in young and aged male mice, we perfused the uterus of aged-sp group with sEV from young male mice and found it could partially rescue the low implantation rate of the aged-sp group. Further in vitro experiments found an induction of DC maturation after treating with sEV from aged male mice than that from young male mice, which indicated an age-related activation effect of sp and sEV. In conclusion, we found sp and sEV from aged male mice could induce the maturation of DC, which compromised the microenvironment of female reproductive tract, therefore leading to a decrease in implantation rate.		6-8 weeks after birth;uterus;ICR
